own the previous non-4k model, and this is a much better experience. First off, It's faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. The user interface is snappier and more responsive all around, unlike the older Fire Stick, which does occasionally lag. It's crisp and clear, and intuitive to operate - and set-up is a piece of cake.If you are wondering whether an elderly or technophobic person can handle the setup process, the answer is yes. The onscreen prompts guide you through everything, and should be easy for anyone to follow, even if don't consider yourself tech savvy. And in terms of the physical hardware, there are only like 2 steps: 1) Connect the Stick to a power source 2) Plug the Stick into any open HDMI port, which you'll find on the back or side of your TV.Also, If you're wondering if the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) suits you more. I would say it\u2019s a question of personal preference. The Fire TV Stick Lite version does not support Dolby Atmos audio and the included Alexa Voice Remote Lite does not have power or volume buttons. Personally, the Lite version is fine for me as I have another remote which controls my TV\u2019s volume and power button and I do not have a soundbar. However, I would recommend anyone with different devices connected to their TV such as soundbars to buy the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) version as this would allow you to control everything all at once, however it is slightly higher in price compared to this one.Finally If you're wondering whether the Lite version is a gimmick or whether it's worth it, the answer is: it's worth it, because it's as if they ironed out all the little kinks and pain points to get the user to their chosen content as quickly as possible. All the little improvements in terms of the speed\/function, and the upgraded Alexa remote with the new \u201cguide\u201d button which takes you straight to your videos makes the Lite version a pleasure to use.Amazon needs to keep up the good work. This Lite stick is a solid product and an excellent upgrade (for those on a budget) from the previous model. Hope this helps!","1":"All functionality is quick and responsive as you would expect so can't be faulted in that respect.However, if, like me, you might side load some additional Apps onto your Firestick, which are not linked to your Amazon Account, you might see that the image \/ icon for the App does not appear in your Apps list and instead you get a \"greyed out\" box. The App will install and work fine once you open it, but the obvious visual for it is missing on your home screen and My Apps lists and if you have a few of them, you will have to guess which app you are opening. Example pictured.This Fire TV Lite OS is Version 7.2.2.3, presumably bang up to date, and this does not happen (in my experience) with previous OS on the 4k Stick for example which is version 6.2.7.3.I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and Factory resets but it is still the same. Might this be a \"glitch\" with the latest OS, Version 7, that needs fixing?","2":"We already have the more expensive fire stick in our main tv which we love.Our second tv doesnt support Brit Box so we decided on another fire stick but opted for this version as its quite a bit cheaper.The only difference is three buttons on the remote.  The ability to turn the tv off and adjust the volume.  Weve never used these buttons anyway as we just use the ones on the tv remote so it was a no brainer to go for the cheaper option.Fire sticks are so easy to set up and use.Plug the little unit into one of your tvs usb ports, plug into the mains.  Switch tv on, select fire stick and follow the onscreen instructions.It supports all the catch up channels plus Netflix ,Brit Box, Disney, the list goes on.Really good interface and will either update your tv to a smart one or update your already smart tv should it not support certain apps.I would certainly recommend this version for price, ease of use and a great viewing experience.","3":"I have every generation of stick except the 4k and they are all still going strong, even the G1. I use them for everything, prime video, Netflix, britbox and all the mainstream apps like iplayer but I also sideload non amazon apps like KODI.  I had absolutely no problem uploading the apps (see pic) and they all loaded with their icons. They work swiftly and I am hugely impressed with the speed of this stick.I loaded in this order. Sign in with Amazon, go to settings and enable apps from unknown sources and ADB debugging in the developer options. Then  loaded the mainstream apps from the amazon store and then side loaded my other apps. All done without problem in less than 30 mins.If, like the other reviewer you struggle with grey icons then Google it. It is not a new problem and there are countless sites with help on how to sort it out.As for the stick itself I really recommend it. I have no need for 4k (due to 720p eyes), i never use the TV buttons on my other controls and I have no need for dolby atmos.  My only gripe would be some price creep  I paid less for my last full featured stick than this lite version. Either way, this is the best streaming device around - buy it without fear if disappointment.","4":"I would like to take this opportunity to amend my initial review as I was a little harsh on amazon not having the i player which has now been sorted and I have it downloaded now this audition to my amazon family of gadgets is now all singing and dancing many thanks to the lovely lady who took the time to ring me and get things sorted out","5":"Be sure you want this product before you order it.  This is because you can only return it if \"unopened, unused & unwashed... and still in its original condition\" -- plus they will \"charge a 15% - 25% re-stocking fee.\"  You can't even feel the comforter without breaking the sealed packaging.  The package I received felt very heavy, but once I took the comforter out of it's sealed packing, it felt much more lightweight, which is what I wanted.  The instructions say \u201cwash before using,\" but the comforter had no odor to it and seemed fine to use without washing.  However, when laying under the comforter it felt heavier than some reviewers had indicated, and it certainly felt heavier than a light blanket.  The quality of the comforter seemed to be good, and I expect in the end I'll be happy with it.","6":"Superb product, easy to set up and use with a huge amount of free channels and apps.Home media is also fast and 100% reliable with the Plex app, downloaded straight from Amazon and no need to fiddle about with developer options etc.Tip: Although the included remote control utilises RF (radio frequency) instead of the usual IR (infra-red), your television \/ universal remote will work with Fire TV if your telly has the CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) function (this may be renamed on your box, so it is worth googling).","7":"Here we go...I spent hours reading product reviews for comforters that were washable, warm and within my budget (under $50). I purchased 2 of these comforters and they arrived yesterday. First off, the Navy and Gray colors aren'tt as dark as the picture shows, no big deal to me as I wasn't concerned about the color as much as I was about it being washable and warm!We washed the Navy one first in a front loading washer - these are big comforters, not too puffy or thick but thick enough that it was a squeeze into the washer. That being said, just run an extra rinse cycle so all the detergent comes out and hang dry over a shower curtain rod or staircase bannister to let it completely dry.Now here's why this product only received 3 STARS: As soon as I took it out and inspected it, so many seams were loose and coming undone! No stuffing had come out, but after one wash seams are already coming loose. We wash our blankets often, and the whole point of finding a washable comforter was so that we didn't need to buy duvet covers. However, after already washing both blankets, it's safe to say that we will be using duvet covers to protect them for more long term use.Now for the positive: This blanket is so warm! Not too fluffy, which is what we wanted, but warm and cozy! I slept so well with it last night inside my new duvet, although I'm annoyed that the blanket seems to already show lesser quality than expected, inside a duvet it should last MUCH longer than if we used and washed it regularly.Overall, not a horrible purchase. In my opinion, will not sustain regular washes, but with a duvet it will last! That being said, buy the cheapest color I'd you are going to end up putting it into a duvet!","8":"Had one and all I got was a bit that says HDMI 1 and that\u2019s it. No trying to load, no amazon. Amazon replaced and second one still the same.Customer services is useless. Been trying to get them to help me sort it. They said they\u2019d phone but kept saying they couldn\u2019t.On chat for 2 hours and still no further and gone through 8 different customer service people as they keep changing them through the chat!So 3 different firestic lites later and they kept saying to replace it. I was speaking to the manager in the end as change in customer service assistants were winding me up. Wasn\u2019t until we were trying to find a solution that I read the small bit on the box that said uk may have issues with it. Never heard that before. Anyway seems certain tv makes aren\u2019t compatible. And my tv isn\u2019t old or a cheap make either. Come to a decision to just refund and I\u2019ll just stick to a normal firestick I already have.","9":"It is very soft and seems to be better quality than I expected for that price. We can\u2019t keep the cat off of it","10":"There are cheaper non-amazon brands out there and the price is huge for the hard reality that Amazon is just gaining more of your privacy. Product will only work with an amazon account, which you will need to create and it obligates you to add a payment method. In other words you are forced to be attached to amazon if you are just looking to use something like Netflix. Clearly your privacy options are gone once you sign those T&C's.","11":"First time ordering a bed set online, but they feel so great! They have been through a few washes and hasn't faded or got ruined. The cotton also hasn't been ruined by the dryer. Very cozy. They stay fresh all night.","12":"Seldom watch T\/V but with the nights drawing in and the current situation felt I might have to! Therefore, for \u00a330 decided to update my eight year old Sony Bravia KDL Model that no longer had the energy or capability to support iPlayer, You Tube etc. Installation, took less than 15 minutes, very easy. Then, the updates since manufacture loaded, and the bar made its progress across the screen and 'Wallah' my television was transformed! Picture quality and sound, brilliant. Still won't be watching much television, but for 'You Tube' it will be great. Money well spent and 'Alexa' too very useful when you're looking for something in particular. Highly recommended.","13":"Had a lot of lint after the first wash. Thought maybe I had something in the wash with it that caused it (although in hindsight, I realize I washed it alone). It\u2019s going on the trash. It\u2019s only gotten worse. The stuffing seems to be coming out in the seams and it even has some tears. Horrible quality.","14":"I haven't given any stars for Alexa integration, for the simple reason that I haven't used it. Can't be bothered with all this newfangled voice control stuff. That's why I went with the Lite version in the first place - why pay for a bunch of bells and whistles I'm not going to use?As for the rest, though, I have no complaints. It was very simple and straightforward to set up and use. The stick is designed to plug into a spare HDMI port on the TV, but wouldn't fit due to a plug in the adjacent port. Fortunately they've allowed for this eventuality by including a short HDMI extension lead, and that did the trick.After that, all I had to do was follow the on-screen instructions to link it to my wi-fi and then my streaming accounts. That was slightly time-consuming due to having to enter all the various passwords and authorization codes, but once it's done it's done and I can watch to my heart's content.The picture quality's fine and I've had no problems. Watching Netflix and Amazon Prime shows via the Fire stick is an improvement from watching via Virgin, because there's no frame-rate incompatibility, so no motion judder.If a programme is left in pause for too long the screen will revert to a photo slideshow, but pressing the \"U-turn\" button will take you back to the Resume option.As for the remote, it's much smaller and lighter than those for my TV, Blu-ray, etc., but the controls are simple and intuitive. My only minor quibble is that using the up\/down\/left\/right buttons to search through menus can make my finger a bit sore (and yes, that wouldn't happen with Alexa, but then my throat might get sore!)Given its small size and cheapness this gadget punches way above its weight and I have no hesitation in recommending it. (And yes, iPlayer and BritBox are indeed available!)","15":"we picked up this two years ago, first the good. upon arrival the comforter was well made, no stray threads or any other quality issues. the coloring is good, uniform and stands up well to cleaning. it is medium weight but does an exceptional job holding in warmth. on a cold winter night it certainly does the job. as to fit it is just as expected no issues there at all.the not so good (mostly due to us). a couple times a year we'd throw it into the washer and had no problems (nearest dry cleaner is a 60 mile round trip). but with time things happen. the last time it was washed, a few months back we noticed some of the quilted threads had started to come loose and pop up. it was only a few no big deal but now unfortunately a lot more of those cross threads are coming loose. again it is just over two years old and it wasn't all that costly so I really can't complain.all said it still looks good but I don't expect to be able to wash this again without it coming apart even more so. we'll keep it til summer which will be the three year mark and then get a replacement. that replacement will be the same as we genuinely have been happy with this the entire time we've had it in use.caveat, dry cleaning would make it last much longer however when factoring the cost to have that done versus replacement after three years it really made no financial sense to go that route.","16":"It came apart right away, the insides filling material started to come out. Regret buying, first time I buy a bad product in Amazon, I order every month for.many years","17":"I bought this comforter in the Taupe color - it is a teeny bit more brown than the picture shows (at least on my computer monitor), but it still matches my bedroom decor really well so I'm keeping it! It is super soft when you run your hand over it and it is super plush - I have not been able to get my cats off of it since I put it on the bed two days ago. I have a full-sized mattress and it covers it evenly, without being too long on any side (I DO fold it down about a foot and a half, which keeps it from touching the floor at the end of the bed). One thing I have noticed is that it gets a bit warm, but it is perfect if you have a\/c running. I imagine that this will be perfect in the winter, and I won't need to pile additional blankets on it to compensate.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase!UPDATE:I have had this for a week now, and one thing I noticed was a defect with a lot of extra string along one of the seams of a few the comforter squares. To keep my cats from getting caught in or chewing on the string, I had to cut it, which ended up opening that seam.  So the squares are now connected, but so far it hasn't made any difference, and I don't think it will in the long run. I contacted the company anyway and they replied quickly and told me to get in touch with them immediately if it causes any issues, so I am keeping my 5 star rating for their fast reply and promise of service.Otherwise, I'm still happy with it, and very glad I purchased it.","18":"I bought 2 of these for my sons room. One red & the other dark blue\/navy. They\u2019re very soft  & washed up nicely. Much better than expected. My boys love them. I was looking for the perfect red for my son! The red is brighter than pictured which is what I was hoping for. He\u2019s very happy with it!","19":"I was searching for an inexpensive comforter set for our guest room. This set fits the bill!  It's very soft and light weight.  I got the taupe in twin size.  The color looks just like it does on my computer monitor.  The pillow sham that comes with the comforter has a flanged edge.  I tried using it on my bed the same way it's shown in the picture.  The flanged edge wouldn't stand up though because the fabric isn't stiff enough.  I ended up turning the sham inside out (so the flange doesn't show) before I put my pillow in it.  The fabric is exactly the same on both sides so I was able to do this.  I think it looks better that way.  The comforter comes in a vacuum sealed package and looks very flat when you first open it up.  I put it in the dryer (on low heat) for 20 minutes before putting it on my bed. It fluffed up nicely! It did look a little wrinkled (even after coming out of the dryer) so I ironed it on low heat without even taking it off the bed.  I haven't washed it yet.  When I do I will take it to the laundromat and wash it in a large capacity washer.  I think the people that had problems with it probably put it in their home washer and it got caught on the agitator.","20":"Bought this mainly as a screen for my Ring doorbell so when door rings we can see who is there.  Unfortunately although it kind of works it only stays on the screen for about 20 secs, which is just after I generally get to the door.  Furthermore if you then ask Alexa to show the front door camera it takes another 10 seconds before the image appears, by which time the visitor has already gone home.  Without the ability to change the amount of time the screen stays on after the doorbell, is rung this is as useful as an inflatable dartboard.Other than that the Echo show is painfully slow to react and this is simply not good enough for anyone who owns a modern mobile phone or tablet.  Its a shame as it has potential.  On the positive - sound and screen quality are good.","21":"The device is advertised as an Echo Show with Home Monitoring facility through the on-board camera. This does not work as there is a known fault with this particular product. Not just mine but all Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen). Based on my experience and the amount of time wasted over the telephone I cannot honestly recommend this product.","22":"The Echo Show 5 2nd Gen is a great device, it's identical in design and build to the 1st Gen, but with a few different features. It has a newly upgraded camera with 2MP instead of 1MP, which means enhanced video call quality, it's now made from a climate friendly sustainable build using largely recycled materials and it also uses less power.So realistically it's pretty much the same great device it use to be with some minor modifications. It's a little bit more expensive but that's just the way marketing works to drive you onto the new device and it still works just aswell in terms of voice activation.I love the device, I love the ease of use, how well it works and the thousands of different skills you can enable to maximise your use of your smart home device. The Show 5 has a nice compact size, has a screen if you want to view video recipes, can set timers, can give you definitions or synonyms, can answer most questions, can play movies, can show you who is at your door, can show you your CCTV and can order your shopping if you want.The possibilities are endless and the device is really impressive. The volume capabilities are decent for the size of it and overall I'm very happy with the value for money. Sure there's not huge improvements on the 1st Gen device, but then the 1st Gen is a perfectly good smart home system that in my opinion didn't really need improved.Conclusion the same great device with some minor tweaks. Don't rush out to replace your existing Show 5 like I did though or you'll be disappointed.","23":"I was at first hesitant to get this. But then once i had some new window screens put up to stop the dogs barking at shadows when people walk past the front door. I as wouldn't have been able to see out ruffly if someone was at the door. I do have camera active doorbell connected to my phone but found loading time can be a bit slow. So decided for security safety to get this as works with my cameras. so i can mount on the wall and be able to keep camera active during the day so i can see who is coming and going.unfortunately i have yet to figure out how to get the camera screen to activate on its own when the door bell rings.The screen is nice and clear and if i wanted to i could use the built in camera to check in from my phone using the echo camera. But i do have security cameras already set up, good for back up if one goes down.The speaker is brilliant and size , design is compact and light enough.Over all it is great buy!","24":"I  have never brought one of these before I was a bit sceptical at first I wasn't going to buy it I am so glad I did I am so happy with it the best thing I have ever brought the sound is awesome thank you amazon very pleased with it well worth the money","25":"Item was well packed and easy to set up - Alexa app already installed on phone so it paired very easily.Normal Alexa functions.Might just be me but photos are not full screen but centred in the middle of the screen.Powerful speaker.","26":"Very pleased, not quite as easy to set up as I thought. Pairing it with my Sony music system proved to be rather problematic.I found it much easier doing it via the pulldown menu on the screen and it worked perfectly (pairing). It\u2019s quite nice having it as a digital picture frame, also constant updates especially weather is very useful. I\u2019m sick of shouting Alexa, so I know call it computer!","27":"Great little thing, can\u2019t see much difference though between 1st and second gen, only camera a bit better, not really worth paying the extra, but then again I love my Amazon products so still very pleased with it","28":"bought this to be able to view my ring doorbell camera so far so good take your time to play with features to get best from it","29":"Good device but room for improvement on the clock display settings","30":"Easy to set up, looks good, sound quality great","31":"Great piece of kit. Sound quality excellent. Stylish displey, very clear screen and ideal size. Lots of great features. Love the security camera. Great value.","32":"This is definitely an improvement over the last model, improved sound good base gives you great music with prime.","33":"Does everything they said, when I work out how to set the music it wakes me up with the fifth star will be given","34":"The UI is a bit sluggish, and either has some usability issues or is a bit buggy. I can't get the clock display I want, or it offers, so I have to ask Alexa the time.","35":"The idea is great but a little small for me,saved up and got the show 10 which is excellent","36":"Reasonable product but no outputs and smaller than expected however the integration and personal organisations are good","37":"would have been 5 stars but this version comes without a plug at the back to enable connection to sound systems\/earphones\/better speakers. I was very disappointed!It does have Bluetooth and younger generations may have all their gadgets Bluetooth enabled - I don't.","38":"Worked out of the box and connected directly to my account A+Great screen, easy to navigate and setup","39":"Love the sound. Bit of a faf to put you photos on at first now good the hang of it really pleased would highly recommend","40":"I feel like, even though it is stated far enough down in the description that this only contains a blanket and one pillowcase, that this is false advertising. It is advertised as a \"set\" and most people in the market for a bed set assume that means a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and a pillowcase, at the minimum. While this is predominantly advertising a comforter\/blanket, it still uses the word \"set\" and features a fully made up bed. After shopping for hours for what I wanted, the reason I bought this was because I thought I was getting a complete set of blanket and sheets. Technically, that's my fault and my brain and eyes' fault for being so focused on a \"set\" but still.....I feel like surely others were conned into thinking that, too? Anyways.....aside from THAT huge disappointment.....I bought Cypress green and it is an army green which I like, but not as rich\/bright as the product page photo. It is more muted\/drab. The fabric is soft enough, the pillowcase is pretty thin, and the overall stitching on both the pillowcase and comforter looks like it won't last long before unraveling. There were stray threads everywhere, some were of the same color, some appeared to come from other products (red, blue, etc). The blanket is lightweight with minimal stuffing when you live in the mountains and are used to high loft down comforters of equal weight. I don't know....I just don't have a very positive first impression of this \"set\" for the price. I haven't washed it or used it yet but I just don't have confidence in it's durability :(","41":"I\u2019m so upset with this purchase. After mainly good reviews and comparing it to other comforters, I got this one in black. Well...it isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s grey. It looked black in the plastic but as soon as I took it out and laid it on my (actual) black sheets...nope. I emailed them but I am also reading that they have a really crappy return policy. I will fight them on this because anyone can see this isn\u2019t black. Will update the review if if gets handled appropriately (i.e they take it back and send me another one without this ridiculous restocking fee). I\u2019m wishing I would have gotten one of the other three that actually came with sheets and shams for the same or less price. The photos are of it fresh out of the bag (which plastic makes dark thinks look darker) and on my bed. First one is without a flash, second one the flash is on so you can really see the difference. The last one is of the shams sitting on some black towels I ordered from Amazon also.","42":"I loved the amount of positive reviews on this product which gave me confidence to purchase.  In particular, I was reading through them looking for how hot this comforter makes others feel as they sleep and found several mentions that people thought it was perfect.  Not too hot.  The comforter arrived almost a week earlier than estimated delivery, which was great!  I love the look of it and it has a really nice soft feel to it.  We went with the black in the oversized king size and it really looked nice on the bed (standard king), draping over the sides and end without touching the floor.  It quickly puffed up after unpacking and placing it on the bed (it comes vacuum sealed in a bag nice and small).Unfortunately for my wife and I, it just did not meet our expectations and was very hot to sleep under.  My wife, who is always cold, told me that she woke up sweating in the night and had moved it off of her.  I managed to sleep through the nights but woke up with the comforter pushed down below my knees.  The temps have been in the upper 60s in the house as fall is setting in, which typically would mean we both have the comforter on through the night. I will say it does have a decent weighted feeling to it as you are under it, and I\u2019m sure some, if not a majority of others, will find this comforter perfect for their needs.  For us it was just too hot compared to our existing comforter.  For comparison\/reference, this was meant to replace our current comforter which is one of the discontinued Sheex brand.For those curious about the customer service or reading other reviews about them, I contacted them about a return and even though it was a weekend I received a response back within a couple hours.  They\u2019ve been simply amazing to deal with as a buyer, delivering much earlier than estimated, answering so promptly regarding a return, and refunding me in full while also providing an amazing solution to the issue of returning the product.  AMAZING customer service from this seller!  Though my rating on the product reflects our dissatisfaction with it, I provided a five star feedback for the seller and can highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase from them.","43":"Beware buying this comforter. Pros:  warm and soft and heavy\/thick. Con:  like so many others here, the seemingly small, white fill threads come out through the outer cover. If you pull one, it becomes a full tuft of stuffing. It\u2019s better to cut, but it will continue to come through. Even after washing in high temp water and a commercial dryer, the outer fabric just won\u2019t tighten to keep the stuffing in!  Because I waited so long, I can only gift them (I bought two) to a charity. I should have listened to all who reported the same problem.","44":"This comforter was perfect for my son's college dorm room.  I was nervous about buying it because a few of the reviewers said it wasn't as long as advertised.  When it arrived, I made a point of measuring, and it was exactly the length described in the product description.  It fit perfectly on his bed, and is really nice and soft. The color was exactly as pictured, and my son told me that it doesn't cause him to sweat at night, which I was really worried about since he gets very hot when he sleeps.","45":"Nautica pajamas are sueded polyester. (\n\nhere\n\n  ).  I took a chance on \"double brushed\" for a simiar feel.  It's not a synthetic velvet feel.One of my younger brothers HAD to have black for his new bed because covering his eyes in his mind is more effective than installing Black Out Blinds on his windows.  Hmmm+ unlike feathers nothing pokes out from the material to jab me+ this is black as opposed to not so black that other black blankets fail to be+ it is true to size (XL twin)+ withstands washing in warm and drying on low (sensor)* it's not as good as blocking all the light from the room especially for someone who sleeps until noon- it's not as ultra soft as I would like:: Will be updated in a few weeks after a field test.update March 2020By Jan 2020 he had lost it in his room.  Up until then he used it in bed, wore it as a cloak on cold mornings, lounged with it in the living room.  It's brother approved.","46":"Fit my college dorm bed perfectly. This was so comfortable to sleep with! When it was over 100 degrees outside, this didn't keep me hot and then when it was super cold, it kept me warm! Would definitely recommend.","47":"I originally bought a queen size for my son. I loved it so much that I bought one for myself in oversized king. Not a lot of color options and I really wanted the Aqua one but it was sold out so I went with the light grey. I loved it so much that I bought a third one in the same color as a backup. I haven\u2019t found a comforter that I absolutely love in years and I didn\u2019t want in a few years to not be able to buy this one again so I just bought a backup for myself. It\u2019s not super light weight but I like heavier blankets. Not saying it\u2019s heavy either. To me it\u2019s perfect!","48":"Nothing junk, nothing special. People need to realize you aren't going to get a $100 comforter for $40. The pillow cases are decent, the ones I already have are softer though. Wish it was a bit bigger, but a size like queen\/full will always be a compromise (slightly small queen\/slightly large large full).The plastic tote bag is absolutely useless though, the only way this fits in the bag is if it is the whole thing is vacuum sealed (like it is shipped). The bag will be useful to pack some sheet sets, but absolutely useless for this.","49":"Very soft and light weight, keep you warm in the cold, and cool when it\u2019s hot. I love the colors, I got Taupe (which goes very well with our sage green sheets) and Grey (for our navy sheets). The comforter is also large enough to cover both me and my 6\u20193 boyfriend, both long and short ways.The only thing I don\u2019t like is that the sham pillow cases are not very soft, so if you\u2019re looking at using those for sleeping, you might want to consider buying different pillow cases.Also, I noticed a lot of people commenting on the comforters not holding up in the wash- I\u2019ve washed on delicates and cold water, and dried on perm press. No issues at all.(Excuse the mattress on the floor picture, we\u2019ve just moved and haven\u2019t bought a bed frame yet).","50":"Excellent delivery & service. Great quality and value for money.","51":"This echo show is the first.oje I have ever owned. But I have loved it all the way. So much so that I will be investing in another one soon.","52":"Bought to replace an ageing DAB radio alarm clock. Very pleased. Speed of response is amazing.","53":"Drop in to friends with show devises.","54":"Nothing to dislike, everything to like about it","55":"The only disappointing feature is the lack of headphone socket.Can use Bluetooth headphones but that is an added expense..","56":"To be quite honest if I knew it was so small I would not have bothered buying it, I have a lots of echos of all styles and this is probably the worst purchase I have made. It now lives in the back of a cupboard","57":"This was a present for my granddaughter to help with her reading and she loves it.","58":"Unable to set up Netflix - followed all the steps signed in to my account  but it doesn\u2019t play anything despite numerous attempts and troubleshooting","59":"It\u2019s great companion and lot of fun.","60":"When I first got this comforter I was in love with it. The color, the feel, the weight were all perfect. Unfortunately, after a few months some white pilling started to appear. I thought it might be from a fluffier blanket I was using on top of it for the winter. However, when I went to pick the pills off, I realized it was the batting coming out right through the material. So now I can't pick these pills off or I'll have an empty comforter.","61":"I purchased two orange comforters for two twin beds. The orange color is vibrant and maintained it's color and thickness  after the initial wash. The width of the comforter does not give adequate coverage. If you are looking for the comforter to go to the floor on both  sides,  you may need to buy the next size up. For example, I should have purchased a full or a queen for my twin bed.  Be sure to take measurements so that you know how much fabric you'll need on either side of your bed depending upon the thickness of your mattress.  Other than the size of the twin comforter, I would buy this product again at a larger size.","62":"I gave this 5 stars at first when I first bought it a few months ago, because I really love it- it's beautiful, soft, and lightweight yet warm. Exactly what I wanted and at a great price. However, after a few washes I started to notice it creating little white pills all over it. At first they were fairly easy to pick off but then when I pulled off some of them, I realized they were coming from inside of the comforter, so the fabric on the inside was coming out through tiny holes in the fabric. It's really disappointing because now it doesn't look nice at all and it's not like I've had it for that long.. \u2639\ufe0f so now I'm on the market for a new comforter. I really love this comforter but it just didn't hold up well. I guess you get what you pay for. It's still usable, I guess. My daughter likes it, and we just upgraded her bed from a twin to a queen, so I guess she can have this one and I will find one of better quality for myself.","63":"SO COMFY\u2014 for about 2 months. And then falls apart. This is the second comforter I\u2019ve ordered from this brand. The first time I was hoping that it was a fluke, but now I see it\u2019s just a very, very fragile fabric. Would not recommend. Two times now, it had ripped for absolutely no reason. I regret buying this brand, this time the rip is absolutely humungous, not sure how to salvage this one but of course, my return window is closed.","64":"I was a little apprehensive about this comforter given some of the crummy reviews. I bought the oversized king in white. Got it yesterday, threw it in the wash, and slept with it last night. I really like it!It is pretty lightweight (not too dense) but still kept me warm and it is cushy enough to be comfortable.I was surprised to see that it fit in my washing machine (Front loading LG) and that my washing machine was able to wash it. Drying was pretty fast as well - I often have to dry my comforters multiple times before they get even remotely dry. This one, only once and then laid it out to finish (but it was mostly done already).So far I am pleasantly surprised with this comforter. I will update if it seems to go downhill.I would definitely recommend","65":"Purchased this to bring on camping adventures and it wound up being the coziest blanket in the house. Thought if it gets beat up, no big deal... didn\u2019t pay a lot for it. So, until it goes on an adventure, it has been put to the test. It has been washed several times, well used, abused, thrown around, jumped on by the dog, and yet always retains it shape, softness, and never turns lumpy. It is great in the Summer and even better for the winter; Very lightweight and yet keeps you warm in the cooler months. Who knew that such an inexpensive blanket could be so great? Buying another for the Master Bedroom and yet another as a backup.","66":"This is a really nice comforter for the price. Soft, comfortable and not to heavy that I feel overheated. I knocked off a start though because the size is misleading. I have a very deep Queen size mattress, so I normally have to buy King size sheets to fit it. Because of this I bought the King\/California King size hoping it would be nice and large enough to cover my mattress. This is a small King size, and I think it would barely fit the top of a Cali King mattress. It hangs over the edge of my Queen size mattress but just barely, which is a bit sad because I like large large comforters. I would double size up if you have a large mattress like mine, and if you have a Cali King or larger (crazy people) this probably isn't the one for you.","67":"One wash in cold water. And hung to dry... The thread has started coming out and the fabric has gone scrunch.!!! We haven't even owned this for two months!!","68":"I love these comforters so much! After a trip to Norway, my husband and I decided that we wanted to model our Queen sized bed the way Norwegians do, using two twin comforters! This way, neither of us hogs the comforter or creates a wind tunnel. And even though these comforters are lightweight, they keep you really warm. So there is no longer a need to pile the bed with multiple blankets in the winter either. For reference, we live in Southern California so while it doesn\u2019t get super cold, we never turn on the heat and even when temps get to just above freezing, we are still fine. The color and softness is also amazing. I\u2019m really happy I discovered this brand! Note: photo was taken right after opening the package.","69":"Ordered this product having purchased goose down alternative bedspreads in the past.  Upon reading the label it indicates that the filling is polyester.  ????  Not what I was expecting as other's I have purchased are lighter weight and not as thick and still warm  during the winter months.  Because I've already washed it before use, base on the instructions, I doubt I will be sending this back.  Feel I was mislead by the meaning of \"goose down alternative\", but will keep it till it falls apart.  FYI  the block stitching did not catch the corners as after it was washed the corners fluffed up and needed some work to flatten out.  Buyer beware.","70":"Excellent product ticks all the boxes","71":"Love it","72":"Very good at voice recognition","73":"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \u00a0It is great","74":"nice","75":"Very good. I now one in each room.","76":"Excellent. But wish there were a few more instructions with it.","77":"Love it","78":"Love it,","79":"I use this for my personal litening  -  about 15vhours a day.  great company.","80":"I was SO disappointed by this product.  Based on the online photo and description, I expect to be very pleased.  Instead, I received a  very low quality product that was a muddy color, with coarse fabric, which was shocking because the description says it is \"Ultra-Soft\" and \"Premium ... Series\".  It is also described as being 88\" x 90\", but it barely covered the queen mattress.  Maybe that is what they mean by \"BARE Home\".  I ordered this for a guest bedroom, but would be embarrassed to have a guest sleep in a bed with this comforter.  I would have given 1 star for the product alone, but I must say that when I tried to return it there was no problem at all;  I was able to take it to a local Whole Foods store, bringing it in its original packaging, although I was told that the packaging was not necessary - they would accept the return without any packaging. So customer service was excellent, but I cannot recommend the product.","81":"We have purchased the purple and orange comforters from this company and love them. They are comfy and warm and perfect for our needs. Unfortunately the red comforter, while just as warm and cozy as the rest, has been horrible at pilling and it has made the blanket look dirty and old. The filling started poking through the fabric after only a few weeks and it just keeps getting worse. You can't pick it off because it just pulls more of the filling through and washing does to help. Basically you are stuck with an ugly mess with no end in sight. I would never recommend this specific color to anyone.","82":"just unpacked my New Comforter and  was disgusted and shocked  to see what appears to be a bed bug!!! How disgusting and upsetting. Thank god I  examined  it before just placing on my bed. buyers beware and inspect new bed products before placing on your beds. I will never shop this company again. nothing they can say or do for me  other than issue my refund ASSP!!","83":"Graveyard worker here. Those who work graveyards\/nightshifts  know how difficult it is to get good sleep during the day. This comforter is just right for me. Not too heavy (if you want weight blankets, this is not the one for you), and not too light either. During the warmer times of the year, it has a goose down feel to it, where it stays cool. During the winter months, it traps the heat without over trapping the heat.Please note this is for Bay area, CA winters so if you live in sub zero areas, this might not be right for you.I should have bought this a long time ago.","84":"Super soft and look great. I bought two for bunk beds in a beach condo we rent out. I bought these because of reviews and price and I am blown away with the comments I am getting on them. 3 renters asked for a link to them because of the quality. (I might be there best salesman). You can not go wrong with these.","85":"I purchased this \u201cdown alternative comforter set\u201d in preparation of the polar vortex circling us in South Carolina. The overnight temps dropped to 24! We don\u2019t prep for that here and unfortunately I live in a 200 yr old house and you can\u2019t run the heat enough to keep warm in those absurd temps. Luckily, this magnificent product dodged the storm in Minnesota and was delivered on time! I simply tossed out the pillow shams, because those are unimportant and popped the comforter on the bed. Presto! Tucked myself into bed and instant warmth; woke up the next day ready to snag a coffee and take on the world. If you\u2019re wanting a great value on a comforter set, this is for you. If you\u2019re going to whine \u201cooo it\u2019s not fluffy\u201d suck it up and buy it anyways, it fluffs out in a bit. Is it lightweight you ask? Well I got a king size because maximum warmth, and for its size it\u2019s middle of the road, not something you\u2019re going to use in summer here anyways when it\u2019s 85 night time temps.","86":"My son loves it.  The color matches the color online.  It has held up to an eight year old's nightly use and daytime playing on the bed for about a month.  Came with a matching pillow sham that my son uses as a pillow case; sham is holding up too.","87":"I got this for myself. I thought since it was advertised for kids that it would be a lower quality blanket and pillowcase. That was fine for me since that seems to be what I can afford. So wrong. This comforter is very soft and fluffy. The fabric feels brushed, not like a curtain or sheets, just really nice. The pillowcase fits my queen size pillow perfectly and it so soft on the face. I am just so very pleased. I know I will be buying another set for winter.","88":"This is a very soft comforter that possibly could have had potential to be a great comforter but I didn\u2019t get a chance to find out because when I received it it had stains on it and I contacted the company and they told me to send them pictures of it and they would resolve things. Which I did and then I never heard from them again!!!!! So I guess I just have to lose out on my money and my comforter. HORRIBLE customer service!!!!!","89":"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \u00a0The comforter looks nice but after a day I noticed that whatever it\u2019s stuffed with is coming out. I have to cut some of the bigger pieces out. It looks bad especially against black. This is a daily thing.I have not washed it and I\u2019m afraid to see what is going to happen when I do. A positive is that it fit my thick mattress with a little overhang. I had a extremely hard time finding a king size comforter to fit my extra thick mattress so kept it. I will be on the hunt for a duvet cover to cover up comforter.","90":"Love seeing what song you have listened to and the news that comes up sound great would tell anyone looking for it to get one","91":"Brilliant  easy to  set up  fantastic  sound","92":"Haven\u2019t used all the new functions yet but cannot not fault the product","93":"Great.  How did I manage  before? No need to search the web. Just ask my Echo.","94":"Great","95":"All round good","96":"Nice compact little unit.  No where near as sharp as Google but as I use this for music it's pretty good.  However, after spending numerous hours talking with support, uninstalling the app, resetting the Show, home monitoring just doesn't work.  It's the same with video calling.  I've tried everything to get this Show to work with the help of support.  I'm going to look for maybe a Google product similar to keep an eye on my 92 year old mum.  I can't really recommend this product as all the functions don't work as advertised :-(","97":"Its a great clock, and is good at distracting you with pointless news stories etc. We found ourselves needing to shout at this before it heard us, which can be quite frustrating. The Alexa in the other rooms could hear us before this one, and we were right next to it!! The speaker was ok for it's size, however after about 9 months it started farting when playing music, to the point it was just unusable as a speaker. So, going back to my first point, it's a great clock!! We have since bought the Show 8 and it's so much better quality. Never buy these at full price, wait until they are on offer as they ain't worth it!!","98":"Echo show - will Not play BBC across multiple devices!! Disappointing.","99":"Very happy with overall however still can\u2019t get the camera to work . For home monitoring, works on face  calls tho","100":"I purchased a few different comforters as I didn\u2019t know which weight would work best for me. I\u2019m a very hot sleeper so I end up kicking off my blankets in the middle of the night all the time so I was looking for something very light weight. This one is pretty good. It is a light to medium weight comfortable comforter. It might get a little warm through the course of the night but I can typically keep it on me all night. Other comforters I typically have to kick off to cool off. If you\u2019re a warm or hot sleeper this would be a good comforter for you.","101":"The comforter is thin. If you want something thick and comfortable this is not the one for you. This would be for someone that is looking for something between comfort and not too hot. So, you can get something between the middle of that. I still decide to keep it as this is for my 3 years old girl and I would rather not let her get stuck under the blanket when she is roll around during sleep time. But, if I'm going to buy it for myself...the answer is NO.","102":"I like this comforter, it will be great for winter, but I don't think I will be able to use it in the summer!  It is pretty warm and even in October with a couple cold nights is still slightly too warm at times during the night.  I toss and turn it off and on.  Its pretty thick and soft, but it is not fluffy like I had hoped.It will be nice for cold winter nights and will save me money on my heating bill!  But as soon as the weather warms up, I know I will need to get another one...**Update**I ended up returning it because it just got to be too warm!  I found myself waking up in the night too hot and sweating and kicked it off the bed.  Its still a nice comforter but if you sleep warm, this one isn't for you","103":"I wasn't expecting this to be as nice as it is for the price. Mine had no issues with loose threads, was sewn well, washed up nicely. Just be gentle with it - any comforter will break threads if you're not a little careful especially when taking a wet one out of the washer, pulling on it. Its sewn with THREAD, not titanium. Color stayed vibrant even washed in hot water. This one is very thick and warm. I don't think I could beat the price for what I received - very happy.","104":"The dark blue is a bit lighter than I was hoping for, but it's still a good looking blue. It matched up well with the new bed sheets and pillowcases from the same supplier. What I don't understand is why it couldn't have fit the bed better. I got a Twin XL, and if it was a foot wider and half a foot longer, it would cover the bed perfectly. That is, it would cover the bed frame and not just the mattress. (A bed skirt is not an option on my adjustable bed.) I'd be happy to pay 3 times as much for a comforter that fit properly, but no one seems to make such a thing. Anyway, the construction is much lighter than my previous comforter, which is OK since I live in the desert. At least it seems to be made sturdy enough out of material that should wear well enough to last a while.","105":"Finally a cozy, soft, plush comforter at a reasonable price! We bought the oversized king and it fits beautifully on our king bed. All the other king size comforters were not long enough width-wise. My husband and I were constantly playing tug-of-war with blankets, but not this blanket. Highly recommend the oversized king for anyone with a king mattress. Seams and threading seem to be fine and the filling is evenly distributed.","106":"I purchased one of the comforters for my guest room and when I opened it and felt how soft and cozy it was, I purchased a few for the living room for snuggling on the couch while watching TV. My dogs commandeered those comforters so I purchased a few more. I have since discovered that no matter how many comforters I purchase, my dogs will claim them as well. I purchased another one for my bed and as luck would have it, my dogs tried to claim that one two. 5-6 comforters later, I either need to get rid of my dogs (perish the thought)  or buy one more comforter and start sleeping in my closet!","107":"Bought the grey version. Nice material, feels soft, but the shams came out with black stains all over them. I've checked, and it doesn't seem to be my washer or dryer. (White sheets went through the next load with no problem.) Nor are there any black marks on the comforter itself, which was washed and dried with the shams.  I'd return it, but I don't care about the shams that much, and shipping the comforter back would be way more work than it's worth.","108":"I was looking for a new comforter that would not only look good but also keep me warm.  This item checks the boxes on both.  It was vacuum sealed so it arrived in a much smaller box than expected but once I opened the bag the comforter expanded and fit my queen size bed nicely.  There was no strong smell and this item is very soft.  I have not tried the pillow shams as I really didn't need them but overall I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend this item if you are looking for a comforter.","109":"I find it very difficult to find an oversized  king comforter. This was also  the exact color I was looking for. It is very soft and comfortable. So pleased with my purchase!","110":"I bought 3 of these comforters. They appear very nice when taken out of the package, but they do not launder well. The very first washing after purchase, 2 of the 3 had the batting from inside coming out. The fabric is extremely thin. These will not last. The quality is poor. Also, they do not breathe and, while lightweight, actually are warmer than a down comforter. That may be a plus for some and a minus for others.","111":"I read the reviews after I bought the set and started to feel uneasy. The pictures make the cover look flat and washed up so receiving  the blanket in a smaller than expected package didn\u2019t help. When I first cut the plastic the cover started to plump up. (A lil scary lol) Once all the plastic was off the comforter was fully plumped! As I opened it the pillow cases tucked in the middle felt like a fancy material. Very pleasant \ud83e\udd70 This set is not photogenic but I posted a pic anyway because I\u2019m soo in love with my new look . I slept like a princess on cloud 9. Thanks!","112":"The comforter is a nice size, the color is nice, well made and the right price.  The comforter could not be used in the summer months due to how thick\/heavy it is.  It is very nice and warm for the winter.  The bad...first order the shams were missing.  I had to order a replacement.  When I took the first comforter to UPS store to return, I had to buy a box (grrr) because the comforter was no longer suction sealed and wouldn't fit in the original box.  The shams are more like a pillowcase with trim.  Very flimsy.  The more times I make the bed the more I dislike the shams looking like a pillowcase sitting on the bed.","113":"This comforter is light weight and comfortable however i just purchased this 4mo ago and already there has been extensive pilling of the fabric and the stuffing seems to be coming out of it through tiny little holes. I\u2019m very disappointed. I purchased this because we have another similar one that we love but this is a different brand and obviously not very decent quality. I would not recommend unfortunately.","114":"This is lightweight, SOFT & comfortable. The Shams arw really pillowcases, but they are fitting for the comforter. THIS IS TRULY A CALI KING SIZE!! I was especially pleased that it FITS my bed and the sides are actually covered when the bes is made. I love it. Is it a $300 set? No..but it's absolutely worth the money paid.","115":"Got this for my daughter's dorm room.  She used it all year and it held up nicely and was cozy for her.  Nice thing is, it will serve as a nice blanket now that she doesn't need a twin long for anything anymore.  Great price for the product.  Would purchase again.","116":"Super soft, but very warm, not at all light enough for a comforter during the summer... however after two weeks and one wash, it might be... considering the amount of stuffing that came out of it when it washed. Multiple holes that were not there when I put it in the washer, and it almost looked like one of the holes was melted??? I hadn't even dried it? I just threw it away. Not impressed.","117":"Initially upon unpacking, the comforter begins to expand, thus releasing loose filling pieces quite a bit. There were also quite a few long, loose, threads needing removed. Some sniped off. Had a fresh off the assembly line look. Other than that. I love the feel. Lighter weight than my goose down. I bought the oversized queen. Which is about right for what I wanted. I just hope when it needs cleaned, the seems hold, and the sizing stays true. Also recommend \"fluffing \" each square pocket for an even look.","118":"I received the comforter with it stuck in the zipper in it\u2019s bag, and it tore a good sized hole. I was so excited to have this comforter I threw it on the bed anyway. I contacted the seller and not only were they so kind and helpful but they are sending me a new comforter and letting me keep the old one. This is by far the best comforter I\u2019ve bought. The Over Sized King is perfect for our California King bed and it\u2019s the perfect amount of warmth at night and it\u2019s not too thick. Love this product.","119":"I bought these comforters for my teen grandsons. Not sure what happened to traditional top sheet, blanket and bedspread.I've been assured today's bed has a bottom sheet and comforter only. They love their own individual comforter.  They arrive vac packed so when the bag is open they litterally pop out. Was fun to watch their faces as the conforter expanded in every direction.","120":"Does not come with a sheet, I should have read the description I just assumed it came with one as all other sets do and based on the price. Besides that, it's pretty soft fabric, the chocolate color is just like the photo, and I do like the thickness of the comforter. The price is however too much, quality in the stitching is clearly not that great. I'm not upset at it but I would not recommend buying it at this price. Reduce by $10 maybe it'll be worth it.","121":"Okay. so at first, i loved this lightweight, comfortable comforter. after having it only for 3 months and taken twice to be dry cleaned, it has tiny pin holes all over the blanket resulting in stuffing coming out of it constantly. it looks terrible too. it looks like there are fuzz balls all over the blanket and you go to take one off and it pulls a long string of fuzz, and it just keeps coming. for the price of this blanket, i would not recommend buying. i will be contacting the seller.","122":"Loved this at first. Nice, soft etc... but then I washed it. I followed washing instructions to the letter. I washed it by itself and there is no agitator in my washing machine. When I pulled it out of the dryer, it had a tiny little holes all over it and there was stuffing stuck to the whole outside of the blanket.","123":"I was looking for a sky blue comforter for my son's bed and this is perfect. It's not super thick, but not super thin either. So far, it feels pretty warm. Washed it immediately with no problems- we're happy with it.","124":"I love the bedding. It is very soft and perfect for my son\u2019s room.  It is very hard to find a solid color bedspread and one right for a teenage boy. He loves it! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the time it took to receive.  I ordered on June 30th and just got it today July 11th.  Taking out weekends and holidays it took 7 business days to get here even though it was a Prime and said it would be here in 2 days.","125":"I\u2019ve found lately that I really relay on other people\u2019s reviews. So I am sending out this message. This comforter is worth the money. The comforter is just an extra for company. I was shocked. When it says light weight. Not sure if that is true. Probably depends on the person. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s just heavy in a way that you know the comforter will last until you feel like redecorating. Or until you, you know?? It is true to its color. I bough a full size. Seems much bigger. Comfort wise I haven\u2019t slept in it. I wish you luck on your search. I give this comforter two thumbs up. I do not think you will be disappointed.","126":"Really happy with the comforter. My daughter has issues with different types of fabrics bothering her. She is excited how soft this is.I had to wash & it does have some loose threads on ends. I told her never to pull if she sees one...thanks to a earlier review from a customer.It is is for her college dorm. So I do not know if it will fit. I will try and upload a picture and review and hopefully it will last at least 1 year at college but I'm not hopeful for much longer then that.Oh we also bought their matching dark grey sheets a few orders ago & they are really soft. Worried dogs nails will tear them ...but so far they are holding up.","127":"I've been looking for a good comforter to use for my dorm, as I didn't want to get my bedsheets dirty. Not only is this size and thickness perfect for colder days, but its super cute and brings out all the vibrant other colors I have in my room!! Sometimes its really hard to get out of bed because of it. Worth it!!","128":"It's just me and my tres hooligan cats. This set has been extraordinary for us, and in the upper midwest. Soft: that is the operative term. The nap of the comforter, as well as the pillow covers is soft wash after wash. Unless you have an extra large washer\/dryer? The comforter does better in a commercial w\/d. Regardless, there is no pilling, no shrinkage, nothing unexpected. Would buy this again in a heartbeat.","129":"We purchased this for a blow up guest bed, realistically it's nothing fantastic. It feels pretty \"cheap\" in comparison to the duvet set I use. However, for what it is, it is soft, fluffy, and warm enough. Perfect temperature for a cool hawaii night. I love the sand color that matches the decor of our cottage. It just doesn't seem made very well, and obviously the filling is polyester which is basically plastic. Reading reviews about it not holding up, I washed it on delicate with a gentle detergent and hung on the clothes line to dry. Pros it dried SUPER quickly and with a vinegar rinse no dog hair stuck to it and it looked brand new after washing despite some muddy paw prints from my dogs before. For the price I think it's a great deal, my guest was happy with it.","130":"This felt like it was going to be a good product. I liked the weight of it when it was packaged. Opened the package and my black comforter looked like it had sat in the sun for a year. Compared it to a year old dog blanket that\u2019s washed weekly and this was lighter in color. Contacted seller and never heard back to I\u2019m returning it to go with another manufacturer. Maybe it was a defective piece maybe they are all like this I will never know. Company never responded.","131":"Its just hard to buy blankets without seeing them and feeling them first. I was less than impressed with this set. Its so thin the fill is next to none. Maybe the material gets softer with washing... time will tell. I had to buy another blanket to go with this. My expectations of what I was getting did not match up with the hyped reviews.If you just want a cheap light blanket for a spare room this might work.","132":"The off-gassing from the inflated plastic bed smells bad and is irritating to my nasal passage even 5 full days in a well ventilated room, with the bed fully inflated. It's really annoying.The smell is likely very unhealthy Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) off-gassing. Although I'm not sure other air mattresses are made of better materials or packaged better. I'll say that I hate being in the room with the bed 5 days after it has been opened up, and it is negatively affecting my visit at a relatives house.Other than that, it's actually a VERY comfortable bed and easy to inflate.","133":"Two of my daughters share a room and have a set of bunk beds. We ordered two of these comforters; one pink and one teal. Both girls love the coziness of their comforters and I like how the two colors look together in the room. We live in upstate New York, so I will probably add a light blanket as an extra layer in the winter, but neither daughter has complained of being cold yet.The bottom bunk occupant is only 2 years old, so I have had to wash her comforter more often due to occasional potty accidents, but so far it is holding up well to washing.","134":"Ordered January 25th.Received January 29th.After washing\/drying Bare Home Comforter, I was taken back on how light Bare Home Comforter was. Was thinking \"no way this will keep me warm at night.\" Told myself...\"Wait to find out.\" Bedtime...Bare Home Comforter was as described....light, soft and most importantly keep me warm throughout the night.Planning on ordering different colors of Bare Home Comforter along with Bare Home Sheets in the coming weeks\/months. I highly recommend Bare Home Comforter....Sheets.","135":"I bought this for my son for his college dorm and was pleasantly surprised. It is soooo soft but the real test was washing it - and wash it we did! Has been through the wash several times and is holding up great - and still so soft. I will be buying another for myself.","136":"Here's why. The comforter is super soft. We got the lighter blue and it is exactly the color I thought it would be. The sticking is very nice, it is super comfy and not crazy soft that's uncomfortable. My only issue, the issue I have with every comforter, it doesn't breathe as well as I want. I ordered this because my other comforter, also bought on Amazon (Wake In Cloud) did not breathe at all. This promised to be breathable and while it is better than my old one, it's too heavy for 70 degrees with the fan on.","137":"4 stars because we bought black, and the color is VERY light black and faded significantly after washing.  It is now a grey comforter. Thankfully, it is for my teenager and he could not care less what color it is. I would not purchase again or for my own bedroom.Otherwise, it is lightweight but warm. My son seems to like and thinks it\u2019s comfy.","138":"I bought this for Christmas and got rid of a comforter that was way too heavy and hot for me. This one is still a little on the warm side, but I realize it\u2019s for winter and I\u2019m just warm blooded at this point in my life. The color is great for Christmas and I have kept it on the bed through January so far with snowman pillows. I just got some valentine pillows in that I think will also go with this color. So I believe I will get lots of use out of it every year!","139":"Comforter was compacted in a vacuum sealed bag, but puffed up to a nice thickness when removed. Nice looking and soft material, feels like cotton, but is synthetic microfiber. Ample dimensions, and drapes beautifully even over a XL twin mattress. Feels like medium to heavy weight and, with generous filling in the cells,  and is very warm. The cover is stitched well, and the color \/ bulk of the filling \/ and  stitching in the cells + seams are holding up well to nightly use and repeated washings over a few months.","140":"Cozy. I couldn\u2019t find a single thing wrong with this blanket. I also didn\u2019t go looking for something to complain about. Its warm. It\u2019s light. What I have noticed is that if you spill anything Or use oily products (like lotion or oils) on your skin it will soak up easily. I have newborn and her Bottle fell over for just a second now I have a stain but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll come out in the wash. Let\u2019s see if the coziness holds up after the first wash.","141":"I really love this comforter. I ordered the Queen size and it is plenty big enough. It comes with a pair of shams which I opted not to use as they look like plain white pillow cases. It arrived in a vacuum sealed package but fluffs up nicely! It is warm and cozy yet not too heavy. Very luxurious look and feel.","142":"We were nervous about the color and we really wanted that rich blue color. It is not quite as dark as in the photo but it was pretty close. It is so soft and I love that it is machine washable. I am always freezing and my husband is always hot and this comforter keeps me super warm but it is lightweight and it definitely does not overheat my husband. We definitely recommend it.","143":"The comforter is the right color.  It was shrink wrapped so very wrinkled.  Fits my california king perfectly.  Should be easy to wash due to its thickness.  Its perfect for my bed, except for in the winter when I'll need something heavier\/warmer.  I'll update if i notice any flaws later on.","144":"This is not the most expensive , elegant comforter I have owned, but it is the most practical.  It goes in my washer and dryer and looks nice.  It has wrinkles when it first arrives.  They come out in dryer.......or wash and dry it.  It isn't too heavy, but warm.  It is soft and the fabric looks nice.  I am very happy with it.","145":"I bought this comforter as a replacement for the one we were using as it\u2019s stuffing melted in the dryer.It came vacuum sealed in a zippered bag. The blanket had a strange chemical smell when I took it out of the bag, but I assume that\u2019s due to some fire retardant that\u2019s on it or from the manufacturing process. The smell was gone after washing.The stitching looks good, the color is pretty and it\u2019s nice and toasty warm at night. I was using a similar style of comforter with a fleece blanket on top of it before, but we had to take off the fleece blanket because it was too hot.Overall, happy with my purchase.","146":"It came neatly packed air sealed. The comforter is very soft! I got the red for my son's room and it is a good color red. The pillowcase was like a regular one. I thought it would be like a matching sham like type of pillowcase but I'm still happy with the purchase.","147":"They're fluffy but carry some weight. Which makes them extra comfy. I originally ordered one for my husband then the girls (11,5) started fighting over his blanket so we ordered them each one in their color of choice and then I ordered my own. So we have blue, green, pink and black ones. Everyone is happy and warm. They feel like they hold the warmth very well.","148":"Overall: High 4\/5Not the softest. Feels like a soft cotton shirt at best but it is very breathable, light weight and very warm!I gave it a 4 star because if you wash this comforter, it\u2019ll start getting ashy! It already started getting ashy after 2 days! Dust and misc. particles get stuck easy and you\u2019ll need to lint-roll it to keep it a deep black.","149":"Perfect weight for in between weather. I am using this under a coverlet on guest bed. The size was ample for my queen mattress with a 3 inch foam topper. The price was great for what I needed. I suspect with heavy use there will be some pilling of the material. It is a fairly thin microfiber. The shams are really thin, but would serve a decorative purpose only. The edge hem on the shams has no body at all . I am not using them however. I bought this to use as a blanket.","150":"I bought this for a guest room, so I\u2019m sure it will hold up well. Compared to other comforters I\u2019ve had, this one has a silkier feel and is much more lightweight. I plan to use a quilt with it so it will be fine. The shams were disappointing - just pillowcases as others have said. Overall, I\u2019m happy with this item and plan to keep it.","151":"Nice bright red, very soft. The only problem is that the white stuffing\/fill is coming through the cover all over the entire spread.  They are tiny pinhole sized but makes the comforter look messy and leaves a bumpy surface.  It didn't happen until after the return period. I would not recommend due to this defect.","152":"I like the color and softness of this comforter. It is definitely not all-season, though; we're roasting in bed at night! I've washed it twice following the instructions on the tag and already there are seams unraveling at the edges. I didn't want to spend a lot of $ on a comforter because our bullmastiff sleeps with us, therefore I wash our bedding frequently. I wanted something quality AND low-maintenance: wash it, dry it and move on. But I guess at this price point, I should have expected this level of quality.","153":"I got this for my son to go to college and I\u2019m so happy with this purchase. I was going to get him a down comforter and the a duvet which would have cost at least $150 but then I read the reviews on this comfortable and decided to try it. I was more than please of the quality and softness of this item. My son says it feels perfect and he can\u2019t tell the difference from his down comforter at home!","154":"My old queen-sized comforter barely draped over the sides of the mattress...this one is perfectly sized for a queen bed and hangs over all sides by over a foot. It's very soft and lightweight enough to not heat you out! I'm thinking of buying another one in a different color to switch it up when I have to wash this one.","155":"Got this blanket because I love the hotel blankets. It's not quite as light and fluffy as the ones I'm used to from hotels, but I do love this blanket. Not too hot or cold ever, fluffy enough to cuddle with, and lightweight enough to not suffocate you, but you still know it's there. Would definitely recommend.","156":"This Bare Home comforter is nice and thick.  It holds up very well to washing.  The sticking does not come apart like on some comforters.  It had one fitted sheet and one unfitted sheet.  I would have preferred both sheets to be fitted.  But overall I am very happy with this purchase.","157":"Thought product would be great, it was soft and my son loved it for his new Christmas bedding present!  We have used it only 4 months and I am having the same problem a few other purchasers have had in that I thought there was lint from our sheets getting on the comforter, but when I used a lint brush and my hand to try and gently pull off lint, I realized it was not lint at all but the stuffing coming out of the comforter.  Even when you gently try to pull off the fuzz just more filling comes out of holes in the comforter.  My son is very disappointed and we have to buy him a new comforter!  I would like compensation and reached out to Bare, we are waiting to see how they will respond.","158":"I LOVE this comforter! Exactly the weight I was looking for. It's somewhat heavier which I prefer having a basement bedroom that's cooler. It's incredibly soft. I tossed it in the dryer out of the bag to fluff it and it fits my queen sized bed great. I prefer the king comforter so I don't have to fight for the blanket.","159":"We purchased this item for my niece's dorm room.  She just loves the look and the feel. It also fit the look she was going for. It is a fantastic value and price.","160":"We've had the comforter for a while but not long enough that we should have stuffing coming out.  At most it gets washed on a delicate cycle once a month.  Even 2 months in we noticed it was showing wear.  I will not be buying this one again.  It is however a nice weight for sleeping in Florida.  As well as overall soft.  Could probably be good for a spare bedroom that doesn't get used much.","161":"I purchased 2 of these comforters for my kid's room, 1 in dark blue and 1 in aqua, and they are as described. So far I have washed the dark blue one and blue lint is transferring to the sheets. I just washed the aqua one today and I'm hoping that it doesn't do the same...","162":"Exactly the right size for a King size mattress with a box spring. All the other \u201cKing Size\u201d must only be for the mattress because they would barely cover it on all sides.","163":"I purchased this for my child in prep of college. At first, I was worried it was going to feel like a synthetic microfiber material. I was surprised how soft it was. It has a velvety brushed feeling to it. After washing it, my kiddo tried it out and he said it was perfect. Very happy with the quality too.","164":"This comforter is garbage. The fill comes out every time it is washed or used. I have washed it four or five times now and each time there is fluff everywhere. When it comes out of the dryer I have to spend 15 minutes with a lint brush and a pair of scissors to make it presentable.","165":"I bought this comforter for my mother and she absolutely loves it! It has the perfect weight to it! It\u2019s soft, and super comfortable! A must purchase!","166":"Love this! I had purchased a twin size just to have something to use when taking a nap. After using it for a while, I had to buy another to use on my bed. It is warm and yet not heavy, comfortable and so soft. You will fall in love with this. Thinking next year I will give one to my family.","167":"I love this blanket!!! So soft and cozy! Beautiful color! I scoured the internet to find an off white comforter and finally found this and I honestly could not be more pleased! My sister in law came to visit and is going to buy one now after just one touch she was in love!","168":"I\u2019m hooked on bare products. We have the soft throw and now recently I bought two navy comforters fir my boys twin beds. These are warm and cozy. I\u2019ve washed them twice now and they come out perfectly clean and in new condition. The fill is sewn into each individual square so it stays nice and fluffy. A lot of kids comforters have more of a silky feeling, this is more of a Cotten feel so it doesn\u2019t slide off the bed.","169":"I bought the same comforter for a queen size bed a few years ago, and the material was twice as thick as this one and very nice and warm. I thought that since the other comforter was so nice, I'd buy one for my full size bed. I feel like the quality has gone down since this comfort is definitely not as thick as my previous one. It is pretty thin, just as thin as the average comforter you can find at Walmart. Be prepared to have to use two blankets for the winter if you're looking for warmth.","170":"I bought the taupe set for my world themed dorm room. The color is true to the photo displayed. Material feels nice and the comforter itself feels like it will be warm for the winter. I haven\u2019t washed it yet, but I did notice some stray strings that look confused. Hopefully they won\u2019t unravel when I do wash it. Overall, you get a nice comforter set for a good price. Let\u2019s hope it lasts four years. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","171":"I buy a lot of Amazon products...that is to say products purchased on Amazon... appliances, home stuff... Even my groceries with Amazon Fresh... And I really think nothing has been a bigger surprise or a more satisfying purchase than this comforter. Warm in winter...cool in summer. Really feels like goose down.","172":"I ordered three of these, one for each kid. Two of them were exactly as pictured, but the third was a really really dark blue, instead of teal. My 8 year old doesn\u2019t mind that she didn\u2019t get the color she wanted so we\u2019re keeping it but due to the mix up I\u2019m not giving full stars.","173":"I bought these for a guest room with 2 twin xl beds that have high mattresses with 2\" memory foam toppers to boot.  These work fine since these beds are positioned in an L-shape each against a wall. Otherwise I'd probably need them a little wider to hang over good on each side.  But, for most twin beds I'm sure they're wide enough.  They're very soft and seem like they'll be comfortable for my guests who use the room.","174":"When we first saw this comforter, we thought the price was excellent and the color perfect for our dark-themed bedroom.The fabric felt lightweight and breathable, so I was happy that it would not be too hot. Unfortunately, I should have taken this as a sign of the poor quality.The first night we slept with it, the blanket was so itchy that I was worried it was infested! Whatever chemicals they use to treat this are incredibly irritating. I washed the blanket and, when I went to switch it to the dryer, found that it had practically shredded itself.I will not be ordering from this company again.","175":"The only positive is that it\u2019s true to size. But the rest is a joke. \u201cDown alternate\u201d for this comforter means cheap polyfil, no feather or comfort to be found. But quality is similar to a clearanced Walmart toddler comforter","176":"I like this comforter, but to me is on the heavy side, which is great for me , cause it is a little cold here. It look wrinkle on the bed, may have to iron on low heat or put in dryer. It is really oversized , which I ordered,  So glad iI did not order the regular king. I am happy with my purchase.","177":"This is one of our guest rooms. The comforter fit the sleigh bed perfectly. It is lightweight and keeps our guests cozy in this season of the year.","178":"Very fluffy and cozy. Great quality. I do feel like it could be wider for king size to hang down longer. Overall worth the money and love it! I use it when needed and like a lighter blanket since I love in a warm climate in Florida.","179":"ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I'VE MADE AS FAR AS A COMFORTER SET IS CONCERNED. LOOKS AND FEELS GREAT AND KEEPS ME WARM AT NIGHT. THE DESIGN OF THE COMFORTER IS ALSO VERY IMPRESSIVE, VERY CONTEMPORARY AND MATCHES MY BEDROOM SET\/WALLS VERY WELL!!!","180":"This comforter is soft, warm & comfortable!  The colors are really pretty! Loved the blues & true to color. I ordered a couple of different colors to see in person & to match the decor in my spare room. As you can see I chose the \u201csand\u201d.  It\u2019s very light weight & warm!  I live in Wisconsin & it\u2019s been very cold so I tried it out the last couple of nights to see if it was warm & it was! The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because after washing the filling did bunch up a bit. All & all I am very happy with purchase, for the price. Since i do use in my spare room I\u2019ve only washed it once so far.","181":"Its so comfortable and soft! Lightweight enough for summer but seems to be just heavy enough to be warm in winter as well (my wife says). I run a bit hotter than her so I'd say it's ideal for winter and just lightweight enough for summer.","182":"This blanket is the end of the nightly struggle of who has more blanket. Each night with a regular King size blanket, my husband and I still has issues having enough blanket as we are both edge sleepers. This blanket is amazing! We will be buying another.","183":"I bought this to make my room and bed look better. It is very soft and looks great. Unfortunately, I wake up heavily sweating every morning and sometimes in the night. Initially, I thought the heater was too high but once adjusting that it's definitely the comforter. If you want something that looks nice or won't be using all night (maybe guest room), get it. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking for something different.","184":"I\u2019ve never purchased black bedding before, but I wish I had done so sooner. This comforter set really looks nice with my sheets of any color. I purchased a Queen size, but it was smaller than expected because my bed sits high; so had I known, I would have ordered a King size. Other than sizing, I\u2019m very satisfied.","185":"I love the color, although it is much lighter than the grey pictured. My problem is, it is very poor quality. After one wash, it came out with a stain. I have tried removing it but it just makes it worse. Each time I was it, another stain appears! There are two rips in the comforter as well. It is also very short, if you do not have a bedskirt, size up! On a positive note, it is soft and fluffy.","186":"I recently purchased a new mattress that is very deep. It's great, but none of my old king comforters were big enough to hang down over the sides of the new, deep mattress. This one, however, does!! It's very soft to the touch, very warm while being lightweight and hangs well over the sides of the deep mattress. I'm happy with my purchase!","187":"I got this blanket because I was tired of the Pok\u00e9mon blanket on my 17-year old\u2019s bed. I told him that no girl is going to want to come into your cave and snuggle up in his bed. He likes it and it matches the vinyl record collection that I gave him.","188":"This comforter is exactly what I was looking for. Stitching is exceptional. Most comforters don't have enough stitching to keep the filler in tact. It's very thick and well padded. I ordered the queen size. Perfect size and fit for the price! Would definitely order this again!","189":"I have washed this twice no in the industrial washing machines at the laundromat without it falling apart. I have had success with this blanket thus far. It is light weight enough for summer usage.","190":"Perfect size I purchased the biggest one because I have a cal king. I haven\u2019t washed it yet but do far it\u2019s holding together. Oh it keeps you warm.","191":"Ok so I LOVE this blanket!!! It\u2019s sooo soft, and comfortable. I was super impressed for the price. I can say that it is NOT lightweight!! I live in Texas where it rarely gets cold enough for a heavy blanket so I was excited to read this one advertised as \u201clightweight\u201d. But it is not. Still using it though! Fantastic comforter.","192":"I honestly wasn\u2019t sure if I would like this when I ordered it, but thought for the price, I would give it a try.  Glad I did.  My husband and I love it!  It is soft, lightweight yet warm and looks great.  I have received many compliments on my bedroom (even though I am still in the process of decorating.","193":"These are really great quality for the price! I bought two for my boys to use on their beds in their bedroom. They wanted something that was a little bit heavier like a weighted blanket, but those are incredibly expensive so I gave this a try instead. I'm really grateful that I did! I'm impressed with the quality. Would definitely recommend.","194":"Received the comforter this evening and I\u2019m in love\u2763\ufe0fI ordered twin xl\/black. It is much larger than what I imagined. It feels so soft and plushy. It\u2019s keeping me toasty and I need that because of arthritis and fibromyalgia in the winter months.Thank you Bare and Amazon!","195":"My kids loved these so much I bought one for each of them. They have a siliconized filling that makes feel what I can only describe as squishy. They are a good bargain for the money. They have been laundered once and look good as new. Can't say how they will hold up in the future.","196":"Out of the package this comforter appeared to be what was advertised. WhoE using it, it keep me extremely hot, often sweating even with the temp in the house turned down and a ceiling fan on.Biggest issue is how quickly the poor quality shows through. Second time washing it and it has shredded. There is nothing in my washer to cause this kinda of damage, especially in multiple places. The comforter barely fits in the washer to begin with so there is no way it\u2019s moving around enough for 4 places to hit the same spot and result in the same kind of damage.","197":"arrived as promised, within a few weeks there was fill coming out of the comforter, in areas not near seams. tiny pinholes with fill coming out, not coolthis is after maybe a few weeks of use without being machine washed, the comforter i had before this, lasted for years without issue, i wouldnt buy this one again","198":"I absolutely love this comforter set. It\u2019s so unbelievably soft. Well vacuum sealed for shipping. Haven\u2019t washed it yet so not sure now it\u2019ll hold up, but I always use delicate and low tumble dry so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work fine.My only disappointment is that the black isn\u2019t dark black. It\u2019s more of a very very dark grey, which is only really noticeable because my sheets, furniture, rug, and tapestries are all black. If you have struggled to match shades of black with your articles of clothing then you know what I mean. Still totally worth the purchase though. No complaints from me! So cozy.","199":"Comforter came with stains on it.  Pillow shams were discolored as well.  Unfortunately, I opened it recently after getting it in November, and I missed the return window.  Very unhappy because other than the stains, it's a nice comforter.","200":"When I first got this I thought it was the most wonderful thing in the world.  So I bought two more.  Now after six months it's just awful.  The puff is gone.  It's pilled.  And it hangs like a limp rag! I hate it!  ugh!","201":"This comforter is nothing like it looks in the ad. It is very thin for the cold months and looks cheap for the price. I guess I really didn't spend much money for it but I thought I was getting a good deal. I kept it for a fall\/spring throw and am using my old down comforter. Don't spend your money.","202":"Bought for a dorm room.  Comforter looks nice is soft and full.  Washed the comforter upon receipt.  After washing the comforter is covered in the interior stuffing.  Had to spend alot of time cleaning with lint roller.  Hoping the second washing is not as bad.  Would not buy this comforter again.Update:  Month later.... continues to shed bad.  Everything covered in stuffing.  Buying a new comforter.","203":"Super light weight (but still keeps you warm) comfy and soft. I loved  it so much, I bought another one for my son ( he loves it, too) Wide variety of colors to choose from-  which makes it very nice, instead of just plain white. I bought the chocolate brown for myself and the black for my son. Very happy with my purchase!","204":"I bought the red and it\u2019s the most beautiful red I\u2019ve ever seen! Over the years, at night  I would get too hot or too cold and it would be a constant on and off with other comforters , no matter the brand or how expensive they were was same issues....With Bare Home Comforter finally found what I\u2019ve been looking for\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffd no more on and off,  somehow it balanced my body temperature and I stayed asleep all night. it\u2019s light  which I love and very soft on the skin. Highly recommend this comforter and the price is very reasonable, plan to get few more colors \ud83d\ude01","205":"We loved this when it arrived but now on it\u2019s second washing it has four separate holes in different parts of the comforter. I can understand one being my fault but four seems like a manufacturer\u2019s defect and we\u2019re very dissatisfied as we\u2019ll have to order a new one from a different supplier.","206":"Love how soft and yet firm this comforter is. It's a perfect match for my silid black bedset","207":"Would recommend. I bought two twin and one queen for my kid to have matching sets. They are great quality. The weight of the blankets are perfect. Almost like a \u201csecurity weighted\u201d blanket. It keeps them warm and I\u2019ve noticed they sleep better with the weight of the blanket. When I want new colors I\u2019m going to order from the brand again.","208":"This comforter is so warm and cozy, and the price is great for the size and quality! We had some issues with the shams that arrived, but the Bare Home customer service was amazing and they\u2019re sending us replacements. Very happy with this purchase!","209":"Nice and soft. Not to heavy. Does not cover my box spring but nothing ever does unless you have a flat mattress\/box spring.","210":"I thought I would try this for the price. The coronet blue is definitely more blue than a blue grey. Not a deal breaker. This is comforter is not breathable. It is very heavy and more like a cotton sleeping bag. I tried it for weeks and just could not grow to like it. In this case you do get what you pay for. If you are picky about your blankets go with another option.","211":"best value ever. comforters can be so expensive and they usually just suck. these things are soft as hell, warm as hell, and very pretty. the only concern is washing the big one, but that's because of it's size, not the material. the twin size ones get clean in the wash no problem.","212":"Very soft and comfortable BUT this is not true black.","213":"I was a little worried when buying these. I saw good and bad reviews and it wasn\u2019t too expensive.  I\u2019m glad I took a chance because it is so nice!! Perfect color and softness. Not to light but not heavy. Just the perfect blanket! I went back and ordered 2 more and I plan to order one for my bed as well :)","214":"Very nice!  Really warm too.  Love the fluffiness.  Quality seems to be very good too.","215":"You Cannot get a better price!  I wanted something simple, lightweight, and light gray to replace my comforter that I'm sick of!  I have decorative pillows, so it had to be plain.  I was afraid of the quality for the price, but I'm quite impressed.  The shams are eh, ok.  The fabric is so soft, that they look thin.  I like my shams to be a little more formed to decorate.  But it's fine...","216":"Comes with Theo shames.  It is pretty light weight and soft. Good for year around use.  Out of the package it is vet wrinkled. I used a iron and lightly went over it hitting the steam button. Took about 10 minutes but almost 100% wrinkle free. For the price it is a good deal.","217":"Its more of a winter blanket than \"lightweight\". My boyfriend will get so warm under the blanket with the AC & fan on that he sweats... But it's comfy and I do really like it. It's just not a \"leightweight\" blanket.","218":"The comforter is so soft and warm enough  for winter weather.  It came vacuumed sealed in a small box and thought it was going to be really lightweight but to my surprised it fluffed up so quickly and has a really nice weight to it.  I wish I had the space to buy more colors because this one, I would recommend for sure.","219":"I love this comforter in the Oversized king size! I always pull the blankets away from my husband on our king size bed.  Not anymore! There is plenty of comforter for both of us to cocoon ourselves while we sleep. The soft, luxurious feel of it embraces my body with a pleasant touch.","220":"So soft!!!  This is a fabulously soft comforter. The size is great it is perfect for year-round on the bed. I love the charcoal color. I would definitely buy more for other rooms in the house","221":"I got the Twin XL hoping for total bed coverage on my Full mattress. Not as wide as I'd hoped. Get the Queen size for a Full. Other than that, it is light so you won't feel crushed like you would under a heavier winter bed cover, and it's soft and warm. Perfect for a New England winter night.**Update**  Got the Full\/Queen. Perfect on my full mattress. Doesn't sweep the floor and has enough left over to pull up under your chin on a cold night.","222":"This comforter exceeded my expectation with much comfort, durability, soft and so light.  It's one of the best purchase so far this year.  I give it a 5-Star overall.  I highly recommend it.","223":"Ahh so happy with this purchase. I spent ALOT of time reading reviews on so many queen sets. I am super pleased with how fast the shopping time was along with the quality in which it came. It is very good material, warm but not so heavy that it\u2019s too much. I am actually a person that gets so hot at night and I\u2019m pretty warm in general and this is the perfect weight. It\u2019s also great as my husband is always cold and he loves it.The pillows are sham style which gives it a more sleek overall look as well.","224":"Got this for my last kid I\u2019m sending off to University and my only regret is I didn\u2019t find this for my three older kids! I washed it and the color held up, it\u2019s ultra soft and the baby boy loves it.  The bed in a bag places the campuses offer have cheap comforters and horrible me sheets that get tons of pilling. This one washes well and was a great value. I\u2019m ordering different colors.","225":"Lightweight, but definitely not the lightest. It doesn't feel like a cheap light-weight comforter. It has some weight to it and seems warmer than many thin comforters I've used before (compare product weights before you buy). It's well stuffed\/quilted with the microfiber filling, but it seems like some of the fibers either pull through (or they're just clinging on) to the outside.  These lighter colored microfibers show up more easily on the the dark navy color (they might be less visible in the lighter colors). But, overall it's a good comforter, especially for the price! Very satisfied after a couple weeks of use.","226":"All of the fill works its way thru the outer fabric and pills. The balled up filling is all over the outer shell and on the rug of the bedroom. They do not know about down proof fabric and what is required in coating or density of the outer shell. The product is a mess.","227":"I love this comforter! It was larger then I thought, and way softer then I thought. I was a little worried when it came because the bag it came in was very compact but let me assure you that once it was opened it fluffed right up and was so soft, and way bigger then I thought. We ordered the oversized Queen and it was great! I would 100% recommend this comforter and would definitely buy again!!","228":"Purchased this after a similar product on Amazon gave my Husband hives after using for one night. Chose these because they are hypoallergenic and free from harmful chemicals and dyes. Super warm blanket, perfect for all season. Was looking to replace an old \u201cpoofy\u201d blanket I couldn\u2019t find anything similar in store And this is exactly what I wanted, nice and fluffy!","229":"Bought this for our guest room. Washed right out of packaging and it washed up well. I did need to iron the shams though. My boyfriend immediately wanted to put it on our bed. Soft and fits nicely over queen size platform bed.","230":"This does cover our California King mattress ( where other \"king\" comforters turned out to be skimpy.) It is a good summer weight and seems well-sown. The fabric is soft and came out of the bag nicely folded. Excellent quality for the price.","231":"Ordered this after going through many comforters to find something that worked for us.Came as should, color on point, no damage in shipping. Fits out queen bed very well.My husband is hot natured, I am cold natured - we don\u2019t have to fight with this comforter. Cool enough for his liking and warm enough for mine.","232":"Used the Super King for a Cali King bed. It actually fits the bed much better than any other Cali King comforter I have bought. Color is nice and the comforter is a bit heavy but very nicely made.","233":"ONCE YOU WASH IT THIS COMFORTER IT SHRINKS UP AND BECOMES CRAPPY. NOT SOFT AND HAS SOME WEIRD TEXTURE TO IT. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.","234":"The quality was not what I had hoped for. It was vacuumed sealed and was so wrinkled. I\u2019ve had it laying out for a few days and it\u2019s still a heap of wrinkles. Also one of the pillow covers was cut wrong and you can\u2019t tuck the flap away.","235":"Comforter seems well made. Good color (dark grey). Weight is too heavy and temp is too hot for summer months in an air conditioned home, so not the \u201call season\u201d breathable comforter as described.  Would have returned but my son promptly cut off the tags before he even put it on his bed. Sigh! Should be nice and warm for the winter, however, I was wanting something for year round use. Nothing really WRONG with it; just a preference difference.","236":"I love it- this is true to color, great quality, light but warm at the same time and although I have not washed it yet  am sure it will be fine. Slept amazing last night and I would order it again. It is easy to put together as the inside of the duvet cover has ties to keep the quilt in place and I LOVE THAT. I never buy duvets because the inside never stays put so this was a nice touch! Thank you so very much!","237":"I loved the way this comforter looked and felt. It was very comfortable. I ordered it once and it ripped so I ordered another one thinking that maybe I washed it on too high of a setting or it was just an accident maybe but the second comforter also ripped after one wash so I do not recommend buying this product.","238":"Comfy, soft, warm, not heavy. Love everything about this comforter-it\u2019s literally the BEST comforter I\u2019ve ever owned or slept under. We love it so much we abandoned a top sheet and sleep with just this.","239":"After two washes, this comforter looks terrible. Pieces of lint coming out if it everywhere. \ud83d\ude12","240":"This item is everything it was advertised for. I love the warmth and softness. I have ordered three more for other family members.","241":"Used on new memory foam bed for grandkids and they both said it's warm. Washed for first time yesterday and it did very well. Dried it spread out over two racks and it didn't bunch up and still felt soft. A good deal.","242":"Nice comforter for the price. Soft and warm.","243":"I purchased the red in a queen size for my queen bed. It is a true red and the queen fits perfectly with plenty of hang on both sides and foot of bed. It is very soft and comfy. Not too thick and not too thin. Easy to clean. It arrived well packaged and quickly. I would definitely purchase again.","244":"We love it.It fits in our washer, it\u2019s soft and perfect for Dallas, Tx winters. Fits a king with extra blanket.We got cocoa, it\u2019s just just like the photos.","245":"This is a great product to help you sleep thru the night. It is lightweight but still keeps you warm enough. Both my Husband and I are very pleased with this comforter. Would highly recommend it to anyone.","246":"Love this comforter so much its soft and comfortable plus I love that it goes down both sides of my bed. I  have already washed it air dryed then put in the dryer on low heat for about 10 minutes, I  am so happy with it I ordered another one for my guest room.","247":"I wanted to love this comforter. Its actually the 3rd one I have purchased. I have the dark green on my son's bed and the blue on our guest bed. They both have held up well and are comfortable. But I just washed the gray one for the 1st time(following the care instructions on the tag) and it did not hold up at all. It appears to have melted in a few spots and the stuffing is coming out and stuck to the outside. It is almost crunchy feeling in several spots.","248":"This is the 2nd set we bought from this company and plan to get one more. This comforter gives us the perfect amount of warmth year round (temps ranging from 25-75 degree nights).  Very soft, washes well, doesn\u2019t ball up or fade.","249":"Just right for the amount you spend.  The comforter is surprisingly warm and cozy.  No need to spend so much money on real down comforters.  The shams are cheaply made but the comforter is okay.  Looks great on our King size bed.  I bought the red one and it really lights up the room.  Its worth the money. It really is.","250":"I was looking for a nice affordable comforter for my son's bed and based on the other reviews I chose this one and I'm so happy I did! It comes vacuum sealed so I got nervous it was a thin blanket and then boom! Once you open the package it expands and is the perfect thickness. It is so soft and comfy too!","251":"We've had our comforter for a couple weeks now. So far, it's wonderful! It's definitely warm, which is why I gave 3 stars for light weight. I took it out and threw it in the dryer to fluff it up and sanitize. The color is beautiful and the seams are durable. Highly recommend.","252":"Perfect weight! Not to heavy but heavy enough for warmth and comfort! They were so nice I ordered another one!","253":"When we ordered this item, we hoped that the item would be warm, soft, and look presentable to the naked eye.  Unfortunately, once  this bedspread was placed on the bed, it wrinkled very easily and the wrinkles did not come out.  We could not use this as a bedspread for our bedding.","254":"The seams are unraveling and I\u2019ve only had it for a month. Definitely not my best purchase. I think the nicest thing I can say is that (while not at all breathable), it\u2019s pretty warm...? Would not recommend.","255":"I love the available color choices these come in.  I ordered six different colors to create a colorful room and they are just perfect.  They are soft, comfy, sewn nicely and a great weight for sleeping.","256":"This comforter far exceed my expectations. It is thicker than our last comforter and will probably last longer. It is very comfortable. The color is a bit lighter from the picture. It is a great product for the price.","257":"I love my purchase! Get yourself some comfort with one of these  omforter sets. Nothing will have felt or looked better on your bed than one of these comforter sets!","258":"I purchased this comforter for my son and he loves it! It's wrinkle free, soft and the color matches exact! It comes with two pillow cases as it states but I only wish it would come with a matching fitted sheet.","259":"We are from South Africa and my son started College in the USA end of August, so we had to order everything online. Not knowing which brands to buy, we had to rely on reviews and descriptions as guidelines. Here in SA we use duvets, not comforters, so this was also a new experience.The first question I asked him about all the orders was, \u201cWhat does the comforter feel like\u201d, and he loves it! He says it is nice and soft, very comfortable, AND LIGHT.  When it comes to bedding we do not believe in buying the cheapest, as he is a swimmer and needs a good nights rest.  Thanks for this great product.","260":"The dark blue color is beautiful and and comforters are a nice weight.  I will say that the shams are rather thin and I would have preferred them to be more like the comforter.  Overall a good deal.  Hopefully they'll wash and wear well.","261":"For the money this comforter is awesome, I've been searching an searching for the \"perfect\" comforter an without spending hundreds I haven't been able to find it. I finally decided on a warm lightweight cozy comforter that will do the job. I found it! Ofcourse it's plain but my plan is to find a duvet cover or two to keep it protected for less washing an to add the flare I want. I would definitely buy again","262":"A comfortably heavy blanket that is plenty warm enough but not too warm. If you're a very cold person you might want something heavier but I find this warmth perfect. Very comfortable as well","263":"I\u2018ve bought this product in different colors because it\u2019s simply perfect. Soft, but not so light that it doesn\u2019t weigh you down for a good sleep. Washes and dries extraordinarily well. I\u2019d LOVE a larger range of colors but I currently have the red and the grey - if there was a better green I\u2019d be on it. BUY IT.","264":"I am not sure I would consider this comforter lightweight, but it isn't heavy either. It is SO comfortable!! It's also pretty soft and floofy! I like it much better than a standard comforter. I will probably end up ordering a couple more in different colors.","265":"Beautiful color, nice feel, and very warm. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the pillow shams are just pillow cases, very thin and plain, too - not what I'd expect, and not on the same level as the comforter.","266":"I really like this comforter. The only reason I gave it a 4 in comfort is that I wish they offered it in stone washed to soften the fabric even more. I have washed 3 times in hot water hoping I could get it to more of a stone washed look and feel  but it still looks and feels like new! Oh well guess I'll have to keep washing or get out my old wash board :) Rit used to have a stone wash powder...maybe I'll look for that.","267":"I really loved this comforter.  I bought it for my son, who really enjoys it. It is very soft and plush feeling, and he really enjoys wrapping up in it. It's warm enough for winter usage, though if it is very cold in your house, I'd recommend using over a plush fleece blanket","268":"My comforter arrived with carpet beetles and it also had stains throughout. My first Amazon purchase that has been so disappointing! Beware, they must have these stored away in a very dusty warehouse. Definitely sending mine back!","269":"For the money, this is a great buy.  It is SUPER soft, lightweight and looks great.The quality seems to be good too and this one came with the shams.  I bought white and it brightened up the whole room.","270":"Excellent quality comforter for the price.  I bought the King\/Cal King and it has generous dimensions compared to other king size comforters I have purchased in this price range. The grey color was true to the color pictured on Amazon.","271":"Some threads came loose after a couple days. The fabric seems nice enough for how inexpensive it is, but that means nothing if it can't hold itself together.","272":"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. The only thing is, when I read it was a \u201cset\u201d I thought that meant it came with a pillow case and sheets but it only came with pillow shams.","273":"Did not even get to use the comforter, as soon as I got the package I stuck it in the washer and began to wash it before putting it on our bed. When the load was done I went to pull it out and fry it and ALL of the feathers were in the washer and the comforter was torn. I made sure I washed it on delicate, so it was not the washer. Very very poor made comforter. I spent money on something and it was ruined within 45 minutes. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Very disappointed.","274":"The wife and I love it, we have bought so many comforters but kept going back to an old one I had cause none of em were even close to the comfort level. But this one is amazing and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll switch it out","275":"It\u2019s not the softest but it\u2019s very comfortable and warm, but not too heavy. i do live out west and it gets pretty damn cold in the winter. this did a dandy job of keeping me toasty.after coming back to this after purchasing in January, now currently in April, i have some things to add. it has gotten a bit deflated, but that\u2019s just cosmetic. also, there\u2019s some threads here and there that come out. other than that, overall i recommended.","276":"Bought the comforter for my son and he loved it!Said it was soft, lightweight and soooo comfortable!!What a great holiday present \ud83c\udf81 to give some one some extra warmth in difficult times \ud83d\udc9d","277":"Awful quality!","278":"OUTSTANDING COMFORTERLIGHT YET SO WARM AND COZYLOOKING FORWARD TO SNUGGLINGWITH FALL & WINTERGREAT QUALITY AND I HIGHLY RECOMMENDTHANK YOU","279":"At first I would have given this 5 stars. So light weight. So soft. But, we\u2019ve had this comforter for 3 months. It is a disaster. For some reason the insides are coming out. We\u2019ve washed it one time and that was just before we put it on the bed. I\u2019m so disappointed.","280":"I bought this for my daughter's dorm room.  She said it was really soft and easy to wash, she wished it was a but warmer, but her electric blanket underneath it works amazing.","281":"I love my new comforter. It is fluffy, soft, comfortable, and looks great.It is really warm too. I usually wear pajamas to bed but I have not needed to since I've put this comforter on my bed.","282":"its lite and soft as described i washed in cold as directed comforter was torn to shreds all ripped at seems had to throw in garbage! lasted 1 week","283":"This was extremely comfortable and lightweight. It was also a soft micro fiber feeling to it. We loved it!  Until I washed it for the first time and a corner unraveled. ( followed washing instructions on tag.) It looks like a string pulled and it just went from there. Then shredded the whole corner in the wash. Causing fluff to go everywhere. Dispute this minor malfunction I think it was a a amazing buy.","284":"The box seemed too small and light but after unsealing it, it filled up to full size. It is very soft and warming. Beautiful color too. Aside from the wrinkles it\u2019s awesome.","285":"Wife wanted those hotel comforters. I figured this was close to it. She loves it and so does the dog. Light weight so you aren\u2019t drowning in blankets but keeps you warm","286":"Not a big fan of the pillow shams, more like a pillow case. The comforter is pretty lightweight and it\u2019s very warm. I love this comforter and would recommend it.","287":"This comforter soaks up a lot of water and becomes very heavy handling. Make sure you have an extra large washer and dryer with gentle cycles, it rips and opens up easily. Would still get another one for a guest bedroom, but not for my main bed where regular washing is necessary.","288":"Very soft and comfortable. First thing my 2 year old grandson ran out of the kitchen with PB&J on his little hands and went straight to the new comforter. I just used a baby wipe and it all came off both comforter and baby. Great product. Bought it in the natural and another in white. The pillow cases\/shams are so soft and really nice too.","289":"This is just what I was looking for it's perfect for my futon in my she shed office. Just the right length and color and it's thick but not too thick because I don't blankets that make you feel way too hot. You can't beat this item for the price and as you can see from the picture the color is gorgeous.","290":"I love this comforter.  Soft, smooth, warm and comforting.  I bought it in Red, oversize Queen.  The oversize fits my Queen bed like a bedspread.  Love it!  For the price especially, cannot be beat!","291":"Purchased this for my sons dorm room.  Soft.  Great fabric that doesn't pile, wrinkle or fade.  Washes great... looks even better after washing.  Perfect weight.  Would recommend this comforter without hesitation!","292":"Love my comforter. It's full and cozy. If my bedroom is cold, I will stay warm up under this and a light sheet. It looks great on the bed too. Only \"issue\" which isnt really an issue is, it takes a little longer to dry. Washed it twice already and usually 30 min by itself worked on my old comforter. This one takes about 45. Still love it though.","293":"The best way to explain this comforter set is as  sturdy. The material is thick and the stitching is well done. This is not a wash a few times and throw it away kind of bedding. It waahes well and holds its shape and doesn't fade. I bought a twin size set for my son and fell I love with it so I had to order us one too!","294":"This is very soft & lightweight, but warm enough for my teen who\u2019s room is now the remodeled, finished basement. I put it directly into the machine straight from the package and it washed & dried beautifully, sewn well with no loose threads or anything like that","295":"The comforter tore on the side after about 2 weeks. I didn\u2019t put it into the washer or dryer I hand washed and hung up to dry then noticed the tear. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re supposed to be able to throw it into the washer and hand dry it but I wasn\u2019t happy with the quality of the comforter at all. Other than the tear, the comforter is soft and pretty cool to sleep with. I wouldn\u2019t buy from this brand again but I wouldn\u2019t change the type of Comforter.","296":"wrinkles on comforter.jeff","297":"The black set is not as rich as shown in the picture. It\u2019s an obvious grey, especially when placed against the rest of my black bedding. It looks very washed out, and that includes the shams.  Unfortunately, its not what I wanted, and I won\u2019t be ordering anything from this seller again due to photos being misleading.","298":"I bought two for my nephew and each was used by him and my husband. One of them had fluff coming out on one side. I called customer service, took a pic, sent it to them and a new one was on the way! They were so friendly and apologetic. My husband and nephew say the comforters are GREAT and very warm. Can't wait to see for myself but according to them, great comforter for a good price and superb customer service! Will definitely look to Bare Home for future purchases.","299":"This comforter set was EVERYTHING you claimed them be. It's warm and soft but not heavy. And the cost was great. THANK YOU and GOD BLESS","300":"Absolutely love this blanket. I live in the south (where it RARELY gets cold enough to turn the heat on) It's a tad thicker than in the picture so if you have night sweats I would recommend doubling up on sheets & using this blanket on the bottom half of your body. I love it, my husband does also but doesnt sleep with it completely covering him because he is very hot natured. I would recommend this blanket to anyone, but more specifically someone who keeps it cold in their house or someone who has very cold winters. All in all it's very soft & comfy. Nice fabric & feels good on your body while sleeping. There is nothing I really dislike about this blanket except I was looking for more lightweight (because of my husband) but we have found alternative methods to using it & both staying comfortable while sleeping.","301":"This is the second comforter I've bought from Bare Home.  We love them!  The quality is excellent, they're very soft, and keep me so warm at night.  I will definitely buy from Bare Home again!","302":"Day one and the threaded seems were already pulling. For the price, I didn\u2019t expect to be over the moon, but I certainly thought it would last longer than a day. The seller also refused my return request. I\u2019m very disappointed","303":"This comforter set is decent, although not quite as warm or soft as I'd hoped. It's fairly lightweight and is an average product. Down comforters are much nicer than this one. But for the price it's not bad. It can be used year-round, through cold and warm weather.","304":"Came apart at the seam  as stuffing started coming out after one wash. It is very heavy and definitely not suitable for spring or summer.","305":"It's a nice blanket but I'm giving them 1 star because I ordered black and it's dark gray \ud83d\ude14 didn't want gray, wanted black.","306":"Very satisfied, thick but not too thick. Have washed 3 times since owning in commercial machine with excellent results. Seems like it will hold up well. The shams were a nice bonus, microfiber, soft, easy to wash and no wrinkles.","307":"This product is great for a comforter. It's super warm and fairly soft. It's definitely a good choice and thus far, there have been no problems with stitching or anything like that.","308":"This green comforter is a gorgeous color. It's not super dark like the picture but I am fine with that. It is a very nice quality blanket. Includes a super soft pillow sham as well. My son was super excited and loves his comforter set!","309":"Soft warm big","310":"So I thought this was pretty great but I\u2019m having the same issue as others with the stuffing coming out in the middle of the fabric. Like just busting out! See photos. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.","311":"I assume this would be too thin, this is perfect and keeps me warm at night. nice material too.","312":"Love this comforter, but easily gets little holes in the fabric and the stuffing starts coming out.  This makes it look ugly.","313":"Not too bulky, warm, lightweight","314":"This comforter is literally the best comforter. It's lightweight, super soft and scrumptious. I prefer to lay on it than under it because it compliments my mattress so well (my mattress is not as comfy as this comforter). Anyways, I got the black, and it's beautiful. I plan to purchase in another color.","315":"This is a great price for this lightweight comforter. I got the light gray, and already have the black. It is very soft and comfortable. I use as a spread and a blanket in Florida. Super nice.","316":"I bought this for my dorm bed & it fits perfectly (twin XL). It\u2019s really lightweight and breathable but also warm when it needs to be. I bought it cuz the color was exactly what I wanted and I liked the minimalist design. The color is perfect and it\u2019s really cozy.","317":"The comforter is soft and looks expensive.  The color was just as expected - loved it.  It is comfortable and not heavy, which is good.  Will order from this company again.  Great value for the price.","318":"Good comforter for the price but was disappointed in the 2 shams that came with it. These shams were as thin as sheets and resembled shams.","319":"OMG I was surprised at the quality put into this comforter. I slept so good with this warm comforter. I get chilly when I sleep and this kept me toasty warm. Great Buy and you get matching high quality pillow cases too. And the size was definitely Queen size!!","320":"I love this comforter. It\u2019s soft to touch, ligt and warm. So good looking that it would be a waste to stuff in into a duvet cover","321":"I wanted to wait to review after it had been through a couple weeks of use and a wash cycle. Great quality! Our dog sleeps with us and it\u2019s super easy to clean in a standard-sized washer. I haven\u2019t had any issues with the wash or dry cycle (followed the tag instructions). It\u2019s not the softest\/fluffiest comforter I\u2019ve ever sleep under. It\u2019s lightweight but cozy. I\u2019ll probably be buying one for our guest room!","322":"Grandson needed a quilt and or comforter for his dorm room. I saw this Grey set and bought it. He wanted Grey!  Nothing fancy and GREY!  It has not been used yet and in a trunk with other items for college.  What I saw thru the wrapping was great.  I know he will love it!  Tank You.","323":"Bought this for my 18 year old to replace his old one. To quote him, \u201cIt\u2019s soft, plush, light weight and warm. And the color is great\u201d Can\u2019t really ask for much more!","324":"I needed a new comforter for my bed (the dog and cat ruined the old one), so I took a chance on this one.  The quality is fine, it looks great on my bed, and the color is exactly what I wanted (taupe\/dark tan).  It also came with two matching pillow shams.  Very satisfied, especially considering the relatively low cost of the item.","325":"Taking one star off because  Of the size.  It sucks when it says king\/  Cal king the measurements on both are absolutely different.  I have king cover and again it\u2019s a little too  big. By about 4 inches.  But the quality is absolutely amazing.  Can definitely compare it  to a $180 comforter.","326":"I purchased this December 4 of last year. And I love it when you first get it you must put it in the dryer to fluff it up this will be my second time purchasing the same comforter due to my large dog eating the first one lol it keeps me perfectly cool in the summer and perfectly warm in the winter","327":"After one month, this comforter has started to rip apart at the seams. The filling is coming out, so it can\u2019t be used.  Very disappointed.","328":"My son loves orange and this bright orange comforter is a hit! Washes well too which is good with a little one who doesn\u2019t use a top sheet.","329":"I wanted a solid comforter for my son\u2019s bed so we don\u2019t have to change it every time we change up the decor in his room. This comforter is very soft and comfortable to snuggle up in. I looked around at a few places and was very happy I found this on Amazon - just what I wanted!","330":"I love these to keep the house cool in summer and warm in winter.  I sew little loops every 2 to 3 feet and hang from screws above the window trim.  The price is great and they really work.  Get a light color if you want sunlight to come in.  Get a dark color to block the light.","331":"I love this light weight, soft comforter. Quality seems great so far. Less one star for the color. It appeared darker in the picture. I personally do not like the blue it is.","332":"I was skeptical to order a comforter set online without being able to feel\/touch it first. I am so glad that I took the chance. I'm in love with this comforter! It's amazingly soft and so comfy. Will be ordering more in different colors.","333":"I liked the comforter until I washed it and ended up with a splotchy pink one. The company refused to exchange it for a new one so it was a disappointing experience.","334":"This comfortable is soft and comfortable but it has the filling coming out all over it. We ordered a black one for my son's room in August and it looks horrendous now because all the white filling is coming out of it. If you try to remove the little piece of filling more follows it.Will never order one of these again and would not reccomend to anyone.  Very poor workmanship.","335":"I just opened it to do this review so I have no idea about its durability or easiness to clean (I take my comforters to the dry cleaners).  It appears to be very nice but I have yet to sleep under it (I will tonight).  You might want me to redo this review tomorrow after I have used it.  One plus is that it is wider than my previous comforter and therefore covers better.","336":"Not great! Not warm! Looks very worn out after a few washes. It\u2019s light weight. I would spend a little more and invest on something better. Bad experience\ud83d\ude14","337":"We are loving this comforter!  It has the perfect fluff, the perfect weight and makes you want to stay in bed all day.","338":"Very comfortable!","339":"My only criticism is that there are permanent wrinkles in one section that I haven\u2019t been successful in getting out yet. Otherwisr happy with it.","340":"I\u2019m so glad I made the decision on this bedding. It\u2019s lightweight, but snuggly & warm! Excellent quality too!  I love, love, \u2665\ufe0flove it! \ud83e\udd70","341":"Seems like decent quality and should be good for my sons dorm room.Haven\u2019t washed it yet so we will see how it holds up.The navy blue is a deep rich blue color. He\u2019s happy with it.","342":"It came on time, and I love it! It is comfortable, beautiful, and soft. HOWEVER, when I washed it was DESTROYED in the washing machine. It\u2019s ruined and I can\u2019t even use it anymore. The fabric is so cheap, and in highly disappointed. Great comforter, but you\u2019ll never be able to wash it!","343":"Covers adequately, would like it more if it was longer on the sides. The color is not as depicted in the picture, it is lighter which is a disappointment because it doesn't match my sheets that are actually as dark as the picture of the comforter.Otherwise, it is light and warm. Bunches up a little when washed, but can be flattened out. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the color. I would recommend this purchase.","344":"Very satisfied with this comforter.  It's soft, comfortable, well-made, pretty and just the perfect thickness.  Not too heavy and not too light.  Good for all year long.  It fits a queen bed perfectly, but be aware that you will also need a dust ruffle (bed skirt) if you have a bed with box springs.  The comforter only covers the top mattress.  Very happy with my purchase and would buy again.","345":"Got this to use for watching tv, or napping in the living room. The twin xlong covers from head to toe. Very light weight, but couldn\u2019t be warmer. Very happy!","346":"This performs like a much more expensive product.  The fabric and fill quality are great.  It washes and dries fast and doesn't fade, pucker or bunch up.  Lightweight yet warm.  With the matching pillow cover that comes with it, makes even my husband's hospital bed look attractive.  No complaints at all.  Great buy.","347":"We purchased the grey & black striped one for my sons dorm and it is a really nice comforter.  Super soft and lightweight.  I liked it so much I went to see if they had one for me but the only pattern one is the black and grey and solids.  Wish they had more patterns for a master bedroom because I would definitely purchase another one","348":"Love this comforter!!! Perfect amount of warmth and it matches my room perfectly. So far it's holding up well to my tossing and turning.","349":"This size is perfect. It is so soft and fluffy. It is way too heavy and hot for the warmer months. This made me upset because our Queen comforter was great year round, even cooling in the warmer months. This one dropped the ball for that reason. Will be happy when it cools off and we can sleep with it again.","350":"I absolutely love this comforter. I have a King size bed and hate that none of my comforters hung below my sheets. This one fits very nicely, and hangs past my sheets nicely. and the quality is very nice, I was worried because the price was so reasonable that the quality would be bad. Not the case.","351":"I would've gave it five stars but...as soon as I opened the package, my Pittie took immediate ownership, seriously! Otherwise a nice buy, can't imagine dollar for dollar a better comforter, thanks!","352":"I was eager to receive this, and impressed by color accuracy (not portrayed well in these pictures due to lighting, but the blue was accurate to the images online) and the soft feeling. However, I found that it had brown stains\/water damage stains (?) all over one side of it. I have contacted Bare Home and will add updates.","353":"I Like That Packaging Was Air Pressured Compact. Easily Wrapped As A Christmas Gift.  The Red Color Is Vivid And The Quality Of The Fabric Out Weighs The Cost. .","354":"Nice quality for the price. Dark Gray is lovely & it has a decent weight to it. Came \"shrink-wrapped\" so take a day or so to smooth out. Will buy in another color for variety","355":"I love this blanket! It\u2019s very soft and I normally sleep pretty hot but this comforter seems to be pretty breathable so I don\u2019t usually wake up hot like I do with others.","356":"I got 3 sets, as I wanted them to all match. They fluff up really nice and I could hardly believe for the price how wonderful they are. I purchased them because they were responable for a camping trip, because my wife doesnt like sleeping bags, they worked wonderful! And made it feel like home.","357":"Bought this for my toddler\u2019s twin bed. Great price and great quality. It\u2019s hard to find a comforter that isn\u2019t too thin after one wash. Bedding was fluffy.","358":"This comforter was exactly as described; utlra soft!  I washed it when I got it out of the package and it washed beautifully.  The comforter is of premium quality, great color (coronet blue), and is fluffy and soft. I purchased if for my grandson for sleepovers and he loves it!  I plan on purchasing one for my daughter as soon as she decides what colors she wants.","359":"We have been looking for the perfect comforter and we finally found it! It\u2019s super soft and lightweight but still warm. It\u2019s like magic! The material has a cooling effect so we don\u2019t sweat but stay the perfect temperature. I haven\u2019t slept that good in awhile!","360":"I have buy my sheets from here always because they are soo soft and actually deep pocketed! I am now going to forever buy my comforter sets from here because wow it is amazing ! Soft, warm, lightweight ! Just perfect ! The color is great !Update: Bought a white set as well and yup still awesome !!","361":"I would love this if it didn\u2019t look awful after one wash. All the white stuffing is coming out and I bought the black one so it looks really bad. Very annoying.","362":"I absolutely am in love w my new comforter. I got it in blue and it\u2019s so pretty. Very comfortable and not too heavy nor too light.","363":"This comforter is great! My 6\u20193 husband are both awful blanket hogs but this works for us most of the time, hah.","364":"I'll still give it a 4 even though its not really breathable. It keeps your body heat in and feels like you are in a sauna. Had to get out from underneith it almost every night so far since i got it. Other than that quality and softness is really nice.","365":"Very soft and warm, description says it comes with pillow cases.... well i don't have them. But i still love the comforter.","366":"This is a bargain for the price. It is true red and it washes very well.  Soft.  I live in Houston Texas and it is great for winters with a light blanket I bought from West Elm.  In the summer, this is all you need.  Very happy and full\/queen fits my full size adjustable bed perfectly.","367":"This is a nice comforter, nice size too.  I bought a duvet to go over it but it's nice to have a comforter that can always double as a nice display comforter or in a duvet.","368":"This blanket is really thin. It's not very warm. After all the great reviews I had high expectations, but was disappointed instead.","369":"Definitely what I expected. Fluffy, warm and soft. Don\u2019t even think twice about ordering this comforter, just do it! So worth it!","370":"After seeing the small box it was delivered in, I expected that it would be going back as too light and thin for winter. Wrong. It is great... light-weight, warm, comfortable, soft, nice stitching around the edges. Even here in the mountains, it is a keeper and a great deal for the price. Black Twin XL.","371":"It is heavier than I wanted so bulky  but I also accidently bought a queen instead of a full, so my bad.","372":"My daughter went from a toddler bed to a twin bed.  I bought this comforter for her first twin blanket.  It is super soft.  Washes beautifully.  Very pretty color purple.  And we couldn't be happier!!!","373":"This product is a gift.  The request was for a green comforter.  I had an impossible shopping trip trying to find green.  Fortunately I found this on line, ordered it...and received it in just q couple days.  I am very please with the look and feel of the product and I am sure the recipient will love it!  PS  the price was also appreciated!  It was less than I expected to pay.","374":"Feels like what I imagine sleeping in a cloud would feel like. I\u2019m going to order two more I\u2019m different colors. So happy I got this.","375":"Very happy with the set when it initially arrived. However, after 3 months of use, the filling is working it\u2019s way out. The weave of the fabric isn\u2019t holding up and is loose enough for the filling to come through. I\u2019m very disappointed and do not recommend this product unless you\u2019re in the market for a \u201cthrow away.\u201d","376":"This comforter is not thick like I wanted it is light weight and very nice color but i wanted a thicker one . I still gave all five stars only because it's very nice just not thick.","377":"This isn\u2019t a great black. It\u2019s almost like an extremely dark green, that looks black. Not sure how to describe it better. In lower light, it\u2019s black, but with any light, you can see a green hue.","378":"Bought this for my son. He likes it. It\u2019s soft and warm. He says it\u2019s better for the winter time.","379":"Nice at First but after a couple of washes the stuffing gathered at the bottom had to buy another set after couple of months","380":"This quilt\/comforter is better than expected.  Poofy squishy interior and soft exterior.  I thought this would feel rough but it's not.  Pillow shams are also very soft.  Love these.  Recommend.","381":"I normally don't do reviews and using the old adages \"you get what you pay for\"  not that expensive it's high-quality. I actually bought a queen for the guest room, live the softness and quality.  I just purchased a king for our master bedroom it comes with two large pillow shams and I absolutely love it. Rich dark blue color ....keeps you warm and toasty.","382":"I bought this twin set for my teenage son.  He absolutely loves it.  It's very soft and cozy.  My son doesn't use a top sheet so this comforter will need to be washed regularly. The comforter fits easily into our front load washing machine and dryer too.","383":"Just bought this comforter for our guest room which we painted tan. The color of the comforter fits in with the scheme great!! It's a great value.","384":"PROS -We have a King size bed (with 3 inch mattress topper) and this comforter was a nice size and oversized enough to drap nicely. It has a nice weight, but not hot & uncomfortable and its soft.CONS - it was not as dark black as I thought...looked more of a faded black. It also smelled as if it was previously washed but not dried properly...almost like a light mildew smell. After I washed it, the smell did disappear.","385":"I came here to purchase another and thought I\u2019d share my opinion real quick. It\u2019s cozy and washes easily. Best comforter I\u2019ve ever owned.","386":"This is very soft and comfortable. I haven't washed it yet, just got it, however it looks well made and is very soft. I am very pleased with this purchase","387":"Extremely pleased with this purchase. Bought it for our 10yr old's bed. She requested a blue comforter and I found this. I love it! It is warm without being too heavy, and soooo very soft! If I hadn't just bought a new comforter for our bed, I'd order another one of these in the king size. It's a steal for the price.","388":"We were looking for an extra wide comforter for our California king and bought this one mostly due to the width. It is perfect; light weight but warm.","389":"Too short and narrow to be used on a queen bed. It\u2019s not as dark blue as pictured; definitely no where close to navy. Soft and medium weight in nature.","390":"It is soft and light weight but after 2 washes it started to fray at the seam.  Washed without an agitator and air dried.  Kind of disappointed.  Will not be ordering another one.","391":"This was purchased for my little one and he says it's just like mommy's. Unfortunately it is, and only unfortunately because I spent 6x the price on mine and I like this one better! Super soft and comfy!!","392":"The hottest sweaty piece of garbage.. boiling hot if you touch it in any way.. this blanket traps more heat than green house gasses.. For those who like sleeping on hot magma. For a guaranteed ruined sleep. Its way to hot to be useful anywhere. This is prob good for nothing.","393":"When I received this set I was very skeptical,  the way it was suppressed in the package gave it a  poor quality appearance.  However once I completely opened it up and felt how soft it was!!! OMG!! It feels so soft and beautiful against my skin! This is one of the best comforter sets I have ever purchased! This product is a definite \"buy again\" thing! Love it!!!","394":"Love this comforter, would definitely buy again and recommend to everyone that does not want a heavy blanket.","395":"Bought this for my elderly mom. She loved it, however, after exactly one year, a seam spit and stuffing came out after being washed. I can\u2019t locate customer service for the vendor. Not happy.","396":"Really nice inexpensive comforter - I got it for a guest room and I use duvet covers properly. Good buy for your $$","397":"This is by far the best comforter I have ever bought the quality of the fabric and it\u2019s very reasonable priced","398":"So soft and fit over my sons XL twin sized mattress perfect!","399":"This is a great comforter. Very nice color, soft and very good quality for the price. Highly recommend.","400":"I will have to find something else for winter. This feels cheap and light. Good enough for our camper.","401":"This comforter is very light weight. You hardly feel it on you and yet can keep you very warm.","402":"Love this! I got the black one to go with my purple sheets and they go well together!","403":"So soft and great quality! It also is a great value for the price! It comes with a sham that we did not use at this time!  I love the gray, it was exactly what I was looking for!","404":"It's soft and medium weight. Great in the summer in a cooled home. In winter you may need to add a throw depending how cold your home is. I'm pleased with it.","405":"Soft, lightweight, affordable comforter... until I washed it once and it fell apart. Really, really disappointed.","406":"Just pulled the comforter out of the package, not as big as I expected and has a hole.","407":"Absolute best comforter I\u2019ve ever owned. Very lightweight for its type. Extremely soft and keeps me warm even through our winter storm with no electricity!","408":"I ordered the light brown comforter. It's \"as advertised\" with one flaw thus far. The white fill\/thread comes through the comforter in various spots on the comforter.","409":"This comforter is amazing. It is very soft and the color is spot on. The weight is heavier than other comforters but will be great in all climates.  My son loves it.","410":"Is it SUPER lightweight? Yes. Is it SUPER warm? ABSOLUTELY!! Ridiculously soft, SURPRISINGLY warm. It gets so hot under this this we sweat. In the winter. When it\u2019s -587468* outside. \ud83d\ude02 Great purchase.","411":"I love that it actually hangs over the sides of my king size bed. Soft and fluffy.","412":"I bought this as a spare comforter because it looked nice and was inexpensive. What a pleasant surprise to find it's much warmer than expected. It's lightweight and very cozy. My son, who has sensory issues, just loves it.","413":"This was an add on and I got it at a great sale price. But it is amazing. I wouldn\u2019t say lightweight as I have some cheep comforters that are a lot lighter but i actually love the weight of it and feel. I will definitely purchase a few more for guest beds etc.","414":"Love the Clemson orange color. Will look perfect in my son\u2019s dorm room this Fall!","415":"These are simply gorgeous. Vibrant and soooo comfy. I use mine as couch covers to protect my leather couches from my dogs.They really complete the cabin look I wanted in my tv room.","416":"It's already torn open. I have ordered a different one from a different seller on Amazon. The pillowcases are nice.","417":"I would highly recommend this comforter.  In the spring and summer you won't need a blanket.","418":"I like the size and weight.  This is a great comforter for any reason.  Great Value.","419":"This comforter dries very fast in the dryer compared to all the comforter I have!! It feels soft and makes me sleep better!","420":"Comfy,  lightweight,  but released an extra ordinary amount of fuzz.  Had to wash multiple times upon arrival to clear fuzz being emitted from filling?  A bit itchy at first, after a few washes, was much better.","421":"I really liked the comforter,  soft, thick but not overly heavy, the orange color was perfect for my son's bed.  The only drawback was the sham, color matched perfectly,  but it was really thin, definitely not the same quality as the comforter is.","422":"Soooo comfy.  My dogs hair doesn't stick to it.  Cozy, snuggly  soft.  Lightweight  but not too light.  Nicely made.  I'm going to buy more colors.","423":"The photo described in this product\u2019s listing is incredibly deceptive. This \u201ccomforter\u201d is thinner than my throw blankets. It\u2019s somewhat soft, but there is no way this provides warmth like a comforter should.","424":"Light weight warm and goes past the bed frameAbsolutely love it.  Thank you for such a great product.","425":"Excellent value!  We were so pleased with the rich color & texture of this comforter & sham- the crimson red was exactly as pictured!  The comforter is soft & has a rich-looking tone and texture- very good value.  Excellent UW Madison dorm room bedding for my son- Badger school spirit without seeming overdone.  I'll update if there are any surprises after washing.","426":"Fits our tempur-pedic queen bed perfectly. soft and comfortable with just the right amount of weight to it. fabric and Stitching looks durable, but time will tell. Very happy with this product, would buy it again. (and just might do so soon.)","427":"I absolutely love it. It\u2019s so lightweight and comfy. Keeps me nice and cozy but not too warm.","428":"The product is great. Its nice and thick so it keeps you warm and the material is very soft to the touch.","429":"This makes my bedroom look clean and neat!!! I have a queen sized bed and this bedding was perfect.","430":"I thought it would be heavier, but all and all it was soft and did the job for what my husband wanted to go with our bedroom decor!","431":"This is my third comforter. Soft, lightweight and warm enough for mild winter weather but not warm enough when it's freezing out.","432":"Great valve and I like that it wasn\u2019t super like weight, glad it has so feel or weight to it...","433":"I really like this comforter. I did wash them already and they still are looking good. It look really nice on my kids bed. I bought 2 of them for my sons' room. They don't look wrinkly after washing. They are still beautiful, and the price is very nice compared to other much more expensive.","434":"Super impressed for the price.  Very soft and plush love it.  It was vacuum sealed so it expands once it\u2019s taken out of packaging.","435":"I love this comforter , Super soft , super comfortable, keeps you warm but not to much weight.","436":"I liked the deep color. The shams fit perfect and sit up nicely. The comforter is lightweight and washable (i wash it weekly due to pets), but I pack it up in the summer. It's warm enough for winter, and a bit too warm to sleep under in the summer.","437":"We had a regular king comforter on our king and it just looked silly. Finally decided to get something bigger and I wish I would have a long time ago. It fits our bed perfectly. Also, very soft blanket and good quality.","438":"I really liked this comforter except I wanted black and this is more of a charcoal color. Other than that, it's great.","439":"Ordered light gray in King\/Cal King for a queen bed. Reviews stated to order up a size, which is 100% true. Color matches exactly as shown in picture. Comes vacuumed sealed so you need to let it sit out a few days to obtain maximum fluff. Seems well made, soft and warn but not to hot. Would buy again.","440":"Always hot with this blanket and not as comfortable or comparable with a down comforter. Disappointed and getting something else.","441":"I love this comforter! It\u2019s light weight yet keeps me warm!  Just an all around comfortable feeling when I pull it over me.","442":"Its comfortable, medium weight, fits perfect on the full with extra on all sides and its soft","443":"Soft, light weight, and warm but doesn\u2019t overheat. Love the simple, clean design and the oversized comforter! Fits great!","444":"This blanket is so comfy but be warned! It gets hot quick. Usually I\u2019m a cold sleeper so it\u2019s not a problem but if you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t like to get too hot, then you might pass on this. It\u2019s very soft, the material is nice. I\u2019ve had it for about 3 months now and there\u2019s been no seams coming undone. Love this comforter, but again, it will warm you up quickly!","445":"I bought this product for my sons, one in red, the other on blue. It is soft, lightweight, and vibrant in color! They absolutely love it, and the younger one makes sure to bring it down for every movie night. When I switch up their bedding again, I\u2019ll be sure to buy these again... just in a new color.","446":"perfect,  color was great, size was perfect,  and shipped fast. Very comfortable and soft and just the right weight to keep warm but not to heavy to over heat","447":"The shipping was a little slow and was not on time but the actual comforter itself was amazing! Very soft and comfy!","448":"I like that it hangs well over a king bed on both sides. Fabric is great. I\u2019d buy it again","449":"Very happy with this comforter! Navy blue is a beautiful rich color and the fabric is very soft. No off gassing smell when I opened the package which was nice also. This was a perfect choice for my toddlers new twin bed.","450":"I absolutely LOVE this comforter! I wanted a new set for my bed and pieced together an awesome combination of things, this being my top blanket and I am obsessed. It\u2019s not only so super soft, but it has that heaviness to it of a down comforter without being huge, puffy, and bulky. Now, it\u2019s not actually physically heavy, but absolutely perfect in that way! And it is SO soft. I won\u2019t have my twin bed for much longer, but once I upgrade to a queen or king I\u2019ll be getting this blanket in those sizes for sure!","451":"Beautiful blanket. Bought it for my granddaughter for her dorm room at college she absolutely loves it","452":"This think is excellent quality and so soft! We have purchased 3 now. Def super warm! Great purchase!","453":"Great Comforter. I am giving it 4 stars because the color is not consistent. We ordered two twins comforters going in the same bedroom and the comforters had a slightly different shade. We ended up ordered a third comforter to get a matching set.","454":"The comforter is great and the sheets. Its not to warm or too cold. It's perfect for all weather. I wish it was prime to get it in two days that is why I did not give it 5 stars. it took a week to get here but otherwise great comforter and planning to buy another one for a gift.","455":"Its so soft, i love it. The pillow covers are nice, as they have a fold to cover the pillow from showing.","456":"Very light weight. Soft and comfortable comforter for great price.","457":"Thought it would be a little thicker but it is really soft. Added a blanket underneath for colder nights.","458":"Very soft and great color! I am impressed with this one, I will purchase again.","459":"My son got this comforter for Christmas and I was extremely impressed by it but wanted to see how it held up. His has been washed numerous times and it\u2019s just as good as it was the day it came out of the package. This comforter is lightweight, warm, and so soft. I just had to get one for myself. It\u2019s like cuddling with a cloud. And it\u2019s well made!","460":"This is by far one of the best purchases that I have made online. I love this comforter so much :)","461":"Love this oversized comforter! I only wished the oversized king came in more colors like the smaller sized comforters. I asked but no response. Want to order more in other colors.","462":"Wow! This blanket is great! I wouldn't say it's lightweight because that makes it sound thin and cheap. It's a nice even weight and super soft. Great quality for the price! I will absolutely buy another.","463":"This comforter was not as warm as I wanted. My son woke up pretty cold at night and needed extra blankets.","464":"Great size and feel for a twin size bed. I would definitely get it again in a different color","465":"Soft, comfy, easy to wash. Just gotta dry on low (learned my lesson on high with a previous comforter). It doesn't stay wrinkle free, I have only washed and dried it twice.","466":"I bought the comforter for my son.  I just put it in the wash for the 1st time and it came out with a 5 inch rip in the fabric!  I lucked out and noticed this before putting it in the dryer and I hand sewed it shut.  Disappointed in the quality","467":"I just love this comforter it is nice and plush but a little thicker than I had hoped for. But that\u2019s not their fault. If you\u2019re looking for a real lightweight summer one this is a little heavier than you would probably want. I will use it for the winter.","468":"I liked this a lot until it split apart at the seams after only two washes","469":"Blanket is super soft and the perfect \"cloudiness\". I have a queen bed but bought the king because I like oversized blankets. Was super easy to wash when I received it. Bought my daughter the same one in a twin size and she absolutely loves it!!","470":"Great comforter for the money, not to heavy yet still very warm. It has held up well to my golden retriever who tries to dig a bed on the bed several times a day. Washes and dries well. Highly recommend!","471":"Comforter seems alright for the most part, my only issue so far is that I ordered black and it's a dark grey in color. I wanted a black comforter to go along with my red\/black bedroom theme and this thing looks so put of place. I used and old faded black gardening glove for reference of color in the pic. I wont return because if nothing else it will make a good spare. I wouldn't recommend purchasing these if you are particular about your color.","472":"I\u2019ve ordered a couple bed comforters off of Amazon and this is one of the better ones! I am super happy with the quality: soft, well made, and washable. I need weight on me when I sleep (more than a sheet) and this is a great in between of a light blanket and a heavy comforter. I would buy again.","473":"that I don't like of this comforter is the color is not black is like old black (looks like brown ).","474":"I gave it as a Chistmas gift to relatives  who asked for it. They seemed very happy to get it.","475":"Nice blanky 10\/10. Keeps me comfy and warm , but it's not super thick and heavy. Looks cute on my bed too :) Exactly what I was looking for","476":"This is the best quilt\/blanket I have even purchased. It is so soft, so warm, and not overly bulky. I am actually gonna order another one as a gift!","477":"For the price it's good. Comfy, soft. The comforter is a nicer quality than the shams in my opinion. The stitching was a bit off on the shams but since I got the black one it wasn't very noticable. I would buy it again.","478":"This was a gift...and they liked itThe color and lightness was what they wanted","479":"Great comforter, great price.  Has weight to it and very soft.  Would definitely buy it again.","480":"Ordered this for myself and my daughter loved how soft and light it was so now I\u2019m purchasing another! Great buy","481":"My concern was that it would make my grey diamond-patterned tufted headboard look cheap. But this comforter in grey complements the bedroom very nicely. Lightweight and soft, it's very comfy. I've had it for about a month or two. No complaints.","482":"Excellent!  Soft, perfect weight.","483":"There is a poor return policy. I wish I'd read the reviews instead of just seeing the star rating and price. The blanket is not what I expected but I got what I paid for, CHEAP. I won't be buying from this company in the future.","484":"Great great great light weight super soft great quality!!!! Love it! Seller was great too! Came in a timely fashion!!!!! Highly recommend!!!","485":"Really soft and REALLY warm. Love the color and the size (oversized queen). Do not love the shams. They're HUGE. I was expecting standard\/queen sized shams. I can't even find pillows to fit inside these! I'm going to have to buy some shams and hope they match the color of the comforter.","486":"This thing is great, warm when you need it to be and cools down when it should, really is a \"all season comforter\"","487":"Bought this comforter and after a couple washes the cotton started to pull out from the inside all over scattered places in the blanket. I threw it away bought another brand..do not waste your money.","488":"I love the color and the comforter is very soft and comfortable. I also like the weight, heavier than most but not overly so. I think it will be a nice 3 season comforter.","489":"So happy that I ordered the oversize King !!  Most other king size comforters do not cover all the bed andrequire a bed skirt which I don't use.This is perfect especially when my husband rolls over and grabs more conforter !!","490":"This is perfect size. I was surprised how small the box was but one I opened it I realized it is vacuum packed....Nice!!!!","491":"First of all,  I bought this for an 18 year old, it's the perfect colors to liven up his room. And he really gets better sleep being so warm in this cold weather.  Really great price!","492":"Great product, great price, good shipping time. For the price it's a nice set. Good quality for lower price. A good light bedspread for the cool summer nights. I'm pleased\ud83e\udd29","493":"Don\u2019t buy. Mine has dozens of tiny holes on the underside already and the inside is coming out. Only owned it for just over a month.","494":"I like it. It has great coverage, I love the color.  It is not lightweight nor heavy.  It is somewhere in between. It is all polyester.  I washed it in cold water and tumble dried low and had no problems..","495":"This comforter is really nice and warm, but what prevented it from getting 5 stars was the coloring of the fabric. The photos make it look like a good solid black, but the one I received is more of a greenish-blue black (it may have even lost more color after washing as instructed). It is definitely not a true black, which is unfortunate because it does not match my black wooden bedframe.","496":"I had read many reviews where they claimed after washing it they would start to see white stuff on the comforter. I washed mines and let it air dry and it looked as good as when I first got it. looking forward to purchasing again in different colors.","497":"Nice comfortable, fluffy, and well made. Happy with my purchase.","498":"It's cheap looking. The comforter looks very thin and has wrinkles that will not go away. The shams finish is not good either. I wished I had spent a little bit more money and get a better quality set. However, I didn't have time to return it because my guest was arriving the day after I received the set.","499":"All of the above.. favorite comforter i. The whole world.","500":"This is a nice comforter. The only problem is it shows as a dark brown (cocoa), but on reality it is lighter brown","501":"Bought two similar comforters for my boy\u2019s beds.  This was by far superior to the Amazon brand.  This was more expensive, but worth it.  Very happy with the quality.","502":"So soft. so fluffy. The size covers the bed, and us, so well!","503":"Bought for grandson needs improvements on stitching","504":"Very good product. Item just as described. Very comfortable. Highly recommend. I am very satisfied.","505":"This set is shipped in a vacuum-sealed bag.  I decided not to keep this comforter set and quickly discovered that I had to pay shipping costs including a box big enough to return it as I couldn\u2019t fit it back in the small vacuum bag.","506":"I bought this set for my mother and she loves it!  The color is more vibrant than displayed in the picture; reminds me of the ocean.  Got at a great price; it was packaged well; and delivered quickly.  It is so soft, actually luxurious.  With so many colors to choose from, I plan on purchasing more.","507":"Very nice addition to my room. Quality is very good, and it's very warm. I do not need any other blanket.","508":"Vibrant black color matches perfectly, soft, cozy, feels like gel but very fine.","509":"Let's just say I bought 2 super comfy.. color as expected waiting on a color to order a 3rd","510":"Very nice weight.  Especially for south Texas weather.  Nice finish material.  I bought King to use as larger queen.  Very pleased","511":"Love love love this comforter!  No more fighting over the blanket because there\u2019s ample blanket for two!","512":"Have only had the comforter for a week but it is nice for the price and washed\/dried well.  I took off one star because of the tags sewn into the tail end of the comforter.  They could not be removed completely--so there are bright white tag remnants visible at the end of the deep red comforter.  Please make completely removable tags.  Thank you.","513":"Perfect comforter!!!!! Best one I have ever owned! Keeps you warm but not hot! Perfect temperature!","514":"This is amazing product for the price what you get is much more than what you may expect. it fits very nice. goes with pretty much any chic colors you have in your room and its easy to dress up your bed with some extra pillows.","515":"It\u2019s super light but sometimes I get so hot it makes me sweat LOL great guest throw blanket","516":"This is an amazing value for the price. It is soft, comfortable, and looks great.","517":"Super soft and nice bright but Suttle color (red).","518":"This comforter is just what I needed....Very soft and light weight!","519":"Fits perfectly for my full sized bed. It's soft and comfortable! Would definitely recommend","520":"It is just as described, and a very nice quilt for that price.  I've been using it over a lightweight blanket for two weeks now and find it perfectly warm enough for fall.  It would be too warm for summer.  I have not tried to wash it yet so don't know how durable it is, but I would use a gentle cycle when washing.","521":"Nice color, soft. Great product for the price. Has held up nicely after being washed.","522":"Ordered this for my son's bunkbed and it's just the best!  He loves it too.","523":"I love this down comforter ...its not only thick and soft.. But also has a great bounce back when squeezed! The black in very deep in pigment ..  I haven't washed it yet but so far I'm very pleased.. I ordered another one after getting the first","524":"Superior product, light yet nice and warm but not hot. Great Value. The Queen size is more than ample to cover my extra high 8\" mattress and box spring. Brightened up my bedroom also","525":"Love that this comforter is extra wide! It\u2019s perfect for 2 large humans and 2 small dogs. \ud83d\ude02","526":"Love this comforter. I have a queen size bed and I ordered the king to give my bed a more comfortable look with the sides hanging off. Very soft!","527":"Bought for my son who is 6'5\".  His height makes it difficult to find bedding that covers him comfortable.  We tried this comforter because it is extra long.  He is happy.  It covers him from shoulders to his toes with a little extra to tuck under his feet.  Pretty color, good durable fabric, easy to clean.","528":"This is a very warm comforter that I needed for my camper. Feels wonderful!! Now I have to order a third one because my 17 year old grandson loves it!!","529":"Very soft and fluffy. A little heavier than I thought but I\u2019m always cold so it works out perfect. I love it! Ordered a King and it fits well. The navy color is lighter than expected but still wonderful.","530":"Just right ,cool in summer, warm in in winter.","531":"Needed a comforter without spending a lot of money. I was very happy when this arrived. It\u2019s so soft and comfortable to sleep with. I would definitely buy another.","532":"Lightweight , looks great and remains wrinkle free... loved the variety of colors!","533":"I bought this comforter in navy for my stepdaughter. We redid her room for her birthday. Pink, gold, grey, and navy accents. IT IS SO SOFT AND FLUFFY! I\u2019m honestly debating buying one for my bed. I love it!","534":"I ordered the twin comforter for my son.  His bedroom is always cold.  He's used a space heater to warm things up but we wanted something safer.  I purchased this comforter... it's soft, fluffy and warm.  I have not washed it yet nor had much wear and tear since it's only been a week, but my son reports that he loves it.  He is warm and not waking in the night due to being cold.","535":"I have bought three of these now for all bedrooms as I was so impressed.  Well sewn, warm, soft, can clean easy , lays flat .Great value","536":"I love how fluffy and soft this awesome comfortable comforter is. It is light and every square on it has an even amount of fluff in it. You dont have to refluff it every night. I just fell in love with it the very first night. Thanks for the BEST comforter i have ever owned!!","537":"For the price, this comforter exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s very soft and fluffy. Great value.","538":"This comforter is very warm while still being lightweight. The microfiber fabric is very soft. This is a steak for the price.","539":"Feels light and soft but is also warm.  Love it so far.","540":"Must buy, I purchased for my college freshman. It looks great in his dorm. The color is perfect. I ordered the blue.","541":"Bought two for XL twin beds.  These are wonderful,  so soft.  Fit is perfect for our new Tempru pedic bed.  Might want to buy more colors.Bare home products are a fav of ours now.  Also, bought sheets.","542":"Honestly not bad a lil warmer than it said it would be. And thicker but we shall see once I wash it!","543":"Very soft and warm. Keeps me warmer than using 2 quilts. And it's very lightweight.","544":"I love it","545":"I love it ! It is so soft and light weight, will see how it holds up in the Tennessee weather this fall will buy again .","546":"I love this blanket.  We have a thing for soft blankets in my house and I was surprised with how soft this one is.  Thought about taking it form my son, lol.  I will be buying another for myself.","547":"Some reviews call it cool, but it holds in a lot of heat. its super light weight with a soft down like feel.  Love it.","548":"So it works really well for winter time, and has no forgiveness in the summer. Just purchased this with a few days left in the 60s at night and it keeps you sweating.Would reccomend for people who are always cold. Is a very soothing blanket for anxiety because of how heavy it is. Would buy again. Just remember it keeps you very hot!","549":"This has been the perfect comforter for cold nights. It is soft, plush and keeps me warm at night.","550":"So happy to find twin xl in a nice shade of grey for teen boy\u2019s room.  Would be great for the dorm.  The color & style are great.  Goes with his dark wood furniture & would go well with natural wood dorm furniture.  He is happy with the texture & temperature.  Add blanket for cold nights.","551":"Love the softness and qualityPrompt delivery a plusVery happy with purchase","552":"Omg when I tell you this blanket is the softest warmest but lightest blanket you've ever had I'm not fcking joking !!! Its 12 and I still havent left my bed lol I never want to leave it is so COMFY and the oversized queen is a DREAM. I used to have a cali king blanket on my queen bed and this new one is way bigger!!! Absolutely amazing I will buy again and again !!","553":"I absolutely love my comforter set.  This alternative down is lightweight, yet warm.  It is soft to the touch and the fabric has a slight shine. I chose the dark brown and it looks like a rich chocolate.  It matches my woodland motif!!","554":"This comforter is perfect! A little over sized so it covers the bed completely and allows for bundling up.  It is light weight, but not completely, which is what I wanted.  Very soft and thick. I love it!!","555":"I ordered it for my grandson and he loves it! Lightweight, soft and fits the bed perfectly. Just was he was looking for","556":"I got this comforter for my mom & we both love it, it's so soft & comfortable my mom says she sleeps better now, I wish it were just a bit smaller but I don't mind that too bad & it fit well in my washing machine & easily washed but it was still new so not sure how easy it is to clean","557":"This comforter started off great, but quickly fell apart. So many tiny holes appeared out of nowhere! If this is a throw away buy, go for it.  If you are buying for use greater than three months, move on.","558":"Bought King for my Queen bed. Fits great, so recommend sizing up. It\u2019s light enough to not overheat, yet comforting enough to not be too cool. It\u2019s perfect yer round!","559":"I bought this comforter for my dog after she ripped a hole in her last blankey, she loves it (see pic)!  She use to beg to get on the couch (which would make nervous because she always gets close to the edge and I don\u2019t want her to fall off). Ever since she got her new blankey she has not said a peep about getting on the couch. \u263a\ufe0f","560":"i bought this some time back and just recently used it. i loved it but the first time i washed it, it ripped.","561":"I'm honestly sad it didn't work out. I bought two for my son's bunkbeds and the first had a year in the middle. I didn't even bother opening the other. It was very soft and puffy and I wish it would have held up.","562":"So cuddly!! Soft as can be. Can\u2019t go wrong with the price either! Highly recommend giving this comforter a run.Mine came with two pillow shams. I know there was some talk on here about only one being included but can confirm two are actually included!","563":"What\u2019s not to love- Great price- Super warm- Absolutely Skin friendly- washable- Great stitch workYou won\u2019t regret it.","564":"After about 6 washings in a front load washer (no agitation) the comforter has developed little pin holes and the fluff is poking out.  It looks terrible.  We'll have to buy something else already. I don't recommend.","565":"Got one for my older son and decided to get a second for my younger one! Lightweight, perfect size, and really comfy!! Boy and mom approved!","566":"It was amazing and beautiful, until the stuffing from the inside was coming out and getting everywhere. It didn't even make it to a second wash. It was trash. A big waste of money! I bought another comforter from Walmart and it's been lasting me for more than 6 months and there has been 0 issues. Do better!","567":"Wonderful soft Fabric. Unfortunately they messed up my order and sent the wrong color and wrong size. I ordered 1 full and 2 twin xl in black all three black. Instead I got a gray full size, a black full size and a black twin xl. So they got 1 out of three correct. Not bad for a $109 order.","568":"Nice weight for a summer comforter and soft.","569":"Would purchase again. Looks and feels great!","570":"Very soft comforter and well made . I am extremely happy with my purchase","571":"Love this. Washes beautifully, very soft and looks great.","572":"Very soft, light weight, good value.","573":"Comfy and light enough for year round use.","574":"Most comfortable blanket I have ever owned. Not to mention a great price at that!","575":"Wow, this is very nice. I will be buying another one.","576":"The color is Perfect!  We just love everything about  this comforter . I brought this for my daughter dorm room and she was very please. I strongly recommend this item","577":"This is not machine washable for me as the label said! I washed in normal\/cold and ended up with a big rip! Used one time and now this is useless unless without a duvet cover. Wash with caution!","578":"I'm very happy with this purchase. Although when it arrived, I was worried that it would be too thin. However, It has actually worked out quite well. We have had this comforter for a few months now and my daughter has actually pushed it off in her sleep from being too warm. Now that we are heading into the winter, it seems to be perfect. She loves the color and says it is so comfy!","579":"This item was described as a set but was only a comforter by itself with nothing else included, definitely was not a set and a terrible price","580":"When I first received the set, I ran it through the wash to be safe. My only complaint is some of the stuffing inside started to come out through the fabric, but I just brushed it off and fluffed it out, after it went through the dryer I couldn't notice any difference.The comforter is very warm and the fabric is very soft along with the pillow cases.I was actually surprised, compared to some more expensive pillowcases i've bought, I actually preferred these ones.Color is great. I am pleased with it","581":"This comforter is so soft and it washed well. Really lightweight and vibrant in color.","582":"This comforter came in a vacuum sealed bag and I thought theres no way it would be soft and fluffy. I was so wrong !! I love it , is so soft and comfortable. Also, I really couldn't imagine that a few inches could make a big difference but I bought the queen short to fit our RV bed and it could not fit any better . Its perfect! I will certainly buy Bare Home again when I need another !","583":"The blankets where for kids you did not have blankets .  They are Christmas presents.  So I don't know how to rate them.Haven't seen or felt the blankets in person.","584":"After weeks of comparing different comforters I went with this one. Definitely by far the best choice.  It has a little weight to it but not a heavy feeling at all. My last blanket my cats didn't like laying on it. Now I have to fight them for it.","585":"Comforter was just not what I was expecting. A little TOO oversized, which I usually wouldn\u2019t mind. The material easily attracts lint as well.","586":"Great blanket. Purchased 2 of them. They are both really comfortable and warm. A little bulky but nothing that\u2019s terrible. Would buy again.","587":"This is my second time buying this set - this time for my son living on a cutter in Maine. It is lightweight enough to make neatly for inspection, yet keeps him warm! Will continue to buy \ud83d\udc4f","588":"After the third wash, it is breaking at the seams and the stuffing is coming out. I can sew it, but the fact it only lasted 3 washes is concerning. Otherwise, it is comy, a bit heavy but not uncomfortably so. I will just buy something else soon just due to the poor quality.","589":"I love this comforter! It\u2019s incredibly soft and comfortable to sleep under, plus it\u2019s washable. I liked it so much that I bought a second one.","590":"Very comfortable and very warm for a cover.","591":"I love this comforter! It\u2019s truly oversized, comfortable, and very warm!","592":"Man is anything on Amazon actually a good product? This comforter feels nice and has good weight to it but its sheds more than an f\u2019ing dog. Every morning I\u2019m covered in little pieces of what looks like lint and dusting them off the sheet. Very very annoyed and i unfortunately would not purchase again.","593":"Soft and pretty pink for my Granddaughter! She loves it.","594":"Ordered the Cal King Black, it looks more of a olive green, it\u2019s not black black (more of a greenish black faded color) and both pillow cases came ripped. I had to sow them","595":"Love. Best comforters I\u2019ve ordered from Amazon.","596":"Excellent product. I changed the decorations in my bedroom and I bought it in Black. Beautiful!","597":"I bought this item during AmazonPrime Day and I am so glad I did. The October nights have been getting colder and this couldn't have been the most softest, warmest and yet lightweight blanket I've owned off Amazon.","598":"Love this comforter we currently have 3 of them in my house my husband hates heavy blankets it\u2019s lightweight and soft so this is perfect. It\u2019s nice and warm without being to warm. We use this cozy comforter  year round. A definite 5 \u2b50\ufe0f","599":"I bought this item for myself. It is the perfect size and is lightweight it is warm.","600":"We love this new comforter, would definately buy again","601":"My kids love this comforter and sham. They are very soft and comfortable and they look great.","602":"The warmth and comfort was amazing last night! Very happy with the purchase.","603":"Very comfortable and seems durable. This comforter is much worth the price. I\u2019ve paid three times for comforters that don\u2019t have this much quality. A quick note, if you\u2019re planning on using it in very cold areas, buy two. I live in Texas so it works perfect for me.","604":"Really nice comforter. Keeps us warm but not so heavy like other comforters. Definitely recommend!","605":"Good quality, warm and soft","606":"I got this set for my sons bedroom redo. I was a little worried what the quality was going to be like when I ordered it because the price was so affordable. But I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It wasnt too light or too heavy, the color was a true red, and there wasnt any other issues with the fabric. My son has loved his new blanket.","607":"Who knew that the oversized King comforter was an thing? For the last nearly 4 years my wife and I have battled with who gets to keep warm at night with our regular sized comforter. THIS comforter as changed this nightly battle into peaceful sleep. The quality, softness, and warmth are secondary to the size but also should be noted.","608":"We love the size of this we finally have a comforter that is big enough for our king size bed and for a decent price","609":"I purchased this for a birthday gift for my niece and she absolutely loved it! It was described as listed by the seller!","610":"I probably should've read the description a little more before I bought it but you can't call it a comforter set if it only has the comforter and one pillow case cover. I was under the assumption that it included a bedsheet too. Aside from that, the comforter itself is really lightweight and and comfortable.","611":"this is so heavy it comes vacuum packed but pops right openso comfy ive already bought another. Thicker than expected and thicker than my expensive comforter","612":"Love the light weight and warmth.  Now a favorite cool evening throw.","613":"This comforter is great! Perfect weight, not too thin or too heavy. I love the color, I bought the dark green. Well made, durable and very soft. I will be buying another in differ color.  I highly recommend this product.","614":"I bought a red comforter When I washed it It shed so much,and had red dye it left stains on the inside of my dryer. I put it in the trash, not good enough for charity.","615":"I bought it for my grandson for Christmas.I know he will love it!","616":"I am not happy with the size or fit of the comforter. I order the king\/cal king n it fits like a queen size on the bed. It was a gift so they opened n used it before I viewed the fit. I added a picture of how it got on the bed. I am not satisfied","617":"I LOVE this comforter. It\u2019s a little heavier than I thought but I love that it actually covers and fits my king size bed with hang room. Would definitely recommend this!","618":"This comforter was exactly what we were looking for! So soft, makes it feel like you\u2019re sleeping in a cloud! It is not super lightweight like I wanted, but it is still a great comforter nonetheless.","619":"Very comfortable lightweight but keeps you warm","620":"This comforter was perfect for my daughters new room....  great quality and she loves it","621":"This is a great comforter, soft, light weight. It's great for spring all the way to fall; in the winter you will need that extra blanket, though. I loved the soft fabric and the color is just what I was expecting. Overall a great purchase","622":"Very comfortable. Heavy enough to keep you warm but not too heavy. However, the insulation material started poking out after about a month of use (without washing it at that point). It only got worse after washing & drying following wash instructions. 2 stars is generous. It looks awful at this point but it still functionally works I suppose.","623":"I got the red color and it is just as it appears online. The comforter is great soft and comfortable. My only concern are with the shams, I would prefer the material to be a bit thicker, but for the price...Overall good product.","624":"Great comforter. Have been looking for an oversized queen and this one is perfect.  It's lightweight but plenty warm enough!","625":"Great quality for the money","626":"eems to be well made, well stitched which holds the filling evenly. I would have given it 5 stars if the color was more like the picture-it is really a blue rather than a blue grey.","627":"I fw it. I\u2019ve been using it for 2 months and it\u2019s great.","628":"Lightweight, but so warm! Nice material! Love it!","629":"After a few shipping glitches, my new comforter arrived.  It looks just like the photo, and is so soft and comfortable.  This will be an excellent way to stay warm and cozy during the long winter months.","630":"Very soft. Your gonna like it","631":"I bought two of these comforters as they are the best I have ever had! Super soft and comfy and wash\/dry beautifully. Excellent in every way.","632":"orange is my son\u2019s favorite color and he loves how soft & comfortable this feels.","633":"I love my red comforter. It fits my bed perfect and makes my bedroom look so pretty. This comforter is very warm too.","634":"Great comforter for the price.  Better than the one i got a kohls that ripped in one night.  Pretty gray, matches my room.","635":"love my new comforter set.It\u2019s perfect in every way and comfortable","636":"Very soft and comfortable - grandson loves it.","637":"This is a beautiful comforter.  I was so happy that the color that I got (blue) looked just like the picture.  So often the color I choose and the one I receive are different but not in this case.","638":"Soft and comfortable. Will buy again for my daughter's room once she needs a new one, as its a good value.","639":"This blanket is amazingly light, soft, and warm.  I did not expect to sleep as well as I have since I started using it.","640":"i slept with this blanket the first time last night and it was amazing! it\u2019s so soft and feels amazing! the door is lighter than the picture which is what i wanted. make sure to wash it before use like it says bc it makes it more fluffy and better. i would extremely recommend it!","641":"Only had it on bed for a month and filling is already coming out. Other than that its ok.","642":"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \u00a0Loving the color and softness.","643":"Very nice warm and soft great fo watching tv and napping","644":"I ordered the twin size to for those cat nap times on the couch.  I wanted something inexpensive and neutral for the purpose.  The quality however is as good or better than my more expensive designer comforters in our bedrooms. So comfy!","645":"This is advertised as oversized king but its not","646":"Received the comforters and noticed right away that the color did not match what was advertised; instead of being a black\/gray it is more of a tan\/gray, which next to a cool gray wall looks awful. Also, i was not impressed with the blanket quality, I expected this to be very soft, but found it to be a cheap scratchy material. The craftsmanship of this product was also sub-par, loose threads every where. To top off my frustration of having to return it, I had to pay $17.40 for shipping costs. Thanks for the kick in the teeth.","647":"Ordered for my Granddaughter...she loves it","648":"Nice heavy comforter. Feels soft and warm. I washed it first and had no issues with the filling or pilling or anything. So far so good. I like it a lot.","649":"I bought a black comforter a year ago and just got a new one, but this time the color is more gray.  Sounds like a supplier or quality control issue that I hope the company sees and fixes.  Please don't sell as \"black\" if it's not black.","650":"It\u2019s very soft and although it\u2019s relatively light weight, it\u2019s a little warmer than I had anticipated. Still all in all, a good purchase!","651":"Not worth it. What I thought was lint, was actually the inside coming out of the comforter, and it\u2019s allll over the bedding.","652":"Great comforter!So soft and warm.Exactly what I was looking for.","653":"Fits great. Soft. Arrived fast","654":"I bought this for my college dorm and it fits my twin XL bed well. The comforter is light enough not to let make me hot but still heavy enough to keep me warm on cooler nights.","655":"This is fantastic if you don't like down comforters....I personally don't.  This looks so nice and is so comfy! So far so good!","656":"I never write reviews, but I was so impressed with the comforter set I thought it deserved one.  The comforter is beautiful, high quality,  and  so comfortable. I am more than happy with the purchase.","657":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She didn't want to get out of bed the next morning........saying \" that was the best sleep I've ever had!\"  She's 15 \ud83d\ude02.  Now she wants another one to use as a bed sheet so she \"extra comfy\".  Unfortunately, I went to order another blanket in Orange (her favorite color) and there were none available.","658":"Alot of loose threads on product. Didn't expect that for the price. Didn't send back due to reviews regarding how it's an hassle to get company to take item back.","659":"Great soft\/comfortable blanket for the price. Keeps me warm enough to crack the window open when it\u2019s 25 degrees outside! Lighter than a weighed blanket but gives that tight warm cuddle like it is one.","660":"Starts to share over time and with wash","661":"Came to change my original review! These melt on low heat in the dryer. Yuck","662":"Great comfortable and lightweight looks great on my queen bed","663":"Looks mad feels amazing. Easy to wash. Lightweight, yet warm. Purchased twin\/twin xl.Daughter loves it and says it\u2019s comfortable and she\u2019s a tad picky! Good buy.","664":"Be warned: coronet blue is NOT accurately reflected in this company's pictures. We thought there was a hint of emerald or something...but it's literally just like a light blue color. We were disappointed.","665":"Pretty lilac color & comfortable","666":"SINCERELY-- this comforter is the best comforter I have ever owned!I knew I wanted a black comforter, but a comforter that was BREATHABLE, COMFORTABLE, & EASY TO CLEAN.This comforter has been all of these things!! (I bought the size: Full; in the color: black)I love the company too-- they reached out personally to check in on how I loved their product.& I am not one to leave reviews, but I wanted to personally leave one for this product-- it was well worth the money.I rest easy every night! & I love how the look created a new vibe for my room!If you're looking to buy-- BUY ASAP!","667":"Love it ! This one actually gives us room to roll and not uncover the other person. Soft like it's already broken in. Highly recommend !","668":"The blanket is nice and warm. The pillow pase had some hard plastic stuck to it and washing it didn\u2019t remove it.","669":"Bought this for my son to use at college. He says it\u2019s really comfortable! Good value","670":"This comforter was softer than I expected and I love how light weight it is. It's perfect!","671":"Beautiful!! A bit warm for Florida's weather,  but great all around.  I love that it actually hangs on the dude of the bed and I don't have to pull one dude while the other is practically on top of the bed.","672":"Terrible quality. After two washes, fiber is coming out of the comforter. Disappointing!","673":"The first time I washed it the comforter split at the seem leaving my washer full of cotton.","674":"I ordered this because it was the cheapest option after my down comforter was the victim of a dog attack. After hours of cleaning up feathers, with no help from the dog, I decided I needed a down alternative and ordered this. I love this comforter and it\u2019s lightweight, warm , and all around amazing.","675":"She loves this comforter","676":"Love this comforter, would have given 5 stars all the way around but the size is not a California king like I ordered its definitely a king","677":"Looks great on the floating platform bed I built. Usually hate sleeping under comforters but this one seems to keep me at the perfect sleeping temp.","678":"Was extremely surprised at the softness and qualityI bought this for my sons dorm room and he loves it so much I\u2019m ordering two as a layered look for his bed at home!","679":"I bought this for my teenage son, he loves it, he says its the best comforter he ever had. It's so soft and has a bit of weight to it, but not so much that it gets hot. We're in Las Vegas so we didn't want anything too heavy. Not sure how well it holds up since we just got it, but so far it seems very well made. I would definitely recommend and buy again if I ever need another one.","680":"Would recommend this to to anyone looking for a quality cover at a reasonable price","681":"Love this bedspread. Super comfortable lightweight breathable but warm.","682":"The softest blanket and covers the whole bed! Love this down comforter","683":"One of the duvets came with a hole right in the center of the cover! Needed it that weekend for guests, and not worth the headache of returning it!","684":"I love this.","685":"We love how soft this is! And the color is the perfect green I was looking for in my 2yo's room.","686":"The comforter does what it is supposed to. It will keep you warm and looks nice on the bed. The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is after each wash, I have to spread it across the bed and use tape to get all of the fuzzies off of it. It looks like whatever fill is used in it is actually coming through the outer material.","687":"This comforter is light weight but well insulated and is very warm. Well made and very much impressed with the quality and warmth of this comforter. Will definitely be ordering more","688":"Soft, great for covering and cuddling,  easy to make the bed.","689":"This comforter is great! I live somewhere warm, but I get too cold sleeping with the AC. This keeps me comfortably warm while the house stays nice and cool for everyone else.","690":"It\u2019s large enough to fit a king bed. Most comforters are way too small.","691":"I love this blanket. I\u2019ve had it for about 4 months and I\u2019m glad I bought it. Some reviews said it falls apart easy but I\u2019ve washed it plenty of times with no problems at all","692":"It tore in the washer first time I washed it. I was so shocked. My washer is front load. Can\u2019t figure out why it tore and not on a seam either. Hard to repair","693":"good quality","694":"Soft, comfortable and breathable sheets.  Quick drying and holds up very well.  I was skeptical buying sheets online, but these are FANTASTIC!  Not a problem at all.  My son loves them in his dorm!","695":"Love this comforter!  Only one problem, the black isn't black but rather a charcoal grey.  However, my daughter loved the conforter so much she wanted to keep it.  In the picture, the sheet is black, and you can see the difference between the black comforter and the black sheet.","696":"Wonderful comforter. So warn and feels great.","697":"I ordered the light gray to go with my blue room. It matches quite well with navy curtains & blue walls. It\u2019s soft and large enough to cover my bed well. Seems of good quality for the price. Full size came with 2 soft pillow shams also.","698":"I absolutely loveeeeee this comforter! Its extremely soft much softer than previously expected due to the very low price. Ever since i purchased this I fall asleep so quickly you will never want to leave the bed. I promise you buyyyy this!!!!","699":"Excellent item! I bought 2. The quality is the best I have bought in years . My kids are so warm and cozy they don\u2019t want to get out bed ! Buy it!","700":"I love this comforter, its soft & feels like you\u2019re being wrapped in a cloud. It certainly keeps you warm, makes me sweat more than comforters I\u2019ve bought at Walmart. But it stinks like a kind of factory smell. Will try washing it a few more times.","701":"As the photos show red thread was used to stitch our taupe comforter. Very disheartening to see this poor workmanship, with no quality control check before shipping.","702":"This is an amazing product. It is lightweight enough to wear even on warmer winter nights I don\u2019t burn up, but also keeps me warm on those below freezing nights.","703":"Would purchase again,great quality,comfort,price.","704":"The comforter isn't as fluffy as I would've liked, but it definitely keeps you warm.","705":"This product is horrible, the material is rough. The \u201cfeathers aren\u2019t feathers at all. This blanket is not comfortable. I wish I could return! Waste of money","706":"I like it. It's soft and big and the color grey is really nice. All like stated in the product description.","707":"Super comfty and soft! Also easy to wash! Only warning is it\u2019s a little heavy so if you use it as a blanket it can get hot sometimes but I just turn on a fan and I\u2019m all good! :D","708":"Very warm and light weight. Extra large king size is awesome.","709":"Ordered 3 of these and they are so soft and the colors are very pretty. Washed very well and stayed soft. Recommend!","710":"These are very lovely!","711":"Older son\u2019s room, he says it\u2019s perfect and very comfy","712":"Bought for granddaughter to take to college - light, washes and dries so easily...Just theright weight for her bed...Great price too. Color is just as it says.","713":"I will have to use these  \"Queen Size\" sheets on a full size bed. Pillow cases were not long enough for Queen Size pillows.Not happy.","714":"We just love the comforter!!  It's so soft and very well made.  We'll be back to order more for other rooms.  Great value for a quality product!","715":"I got the xl king and it fits perfectly big!! It's pretty lightweight, but keeps me perfectly warm! No bunching after washing!","716":"My child needed a black comforter for school. Perfect color. Have used it yet.","717":"I love it. Soft and very comfortable. Will order again.","718":"Beautiful.","719":"This is the second of this comforter I\u2019ve bought. First one was when I had a twin bed and I loved that blanket so when I upsized I got a full, still just as good! Soft, washes easily in a regular machine, not super thick or heavy but it still keeps you very warm. I have the dark blue, beautiful color! Just all around a perfect comforter","720":"Perfect and so reasonable","721":"Covered the sides of the bed (king) like I wanted. Bed stand tall. Perfect! And no wrinkles!","722":"Works for me","723":"Bought this for a full size bed, it fits very generously all around.  Soft, lightweight, and stays in place.  I don't sweat at night as much, yet it keeps me warm when it's chilly.  Love it!","724":"It's an adequate blanket. I'm using it. The problem I have with it is that the down alternative stuffing comes through the material little by little onto my sheets. Will it all come out eventually? No idea, but maybe.","725":"Love!!! perfect for summer nights. Makes the bed look clean and well put together. It is a fluffy type of blanket it\u2019s very comfortable.","726":"Ordered it once, it CAME torn. Got another one sent out, it was fine. Put it in the washer, and as I opened the door I could see the fabric torn in several spots. Quality of fabric is awful.","727":"this is a gift","728":"Exactly what I ordered.","729":"Very nice product exactly what I wanted .","730":"This was excellent and beautiful.  I would purchase and recommend to others who used down comforters.","731":"\u2026.","732":"Hubby went on a trip and used this on a cot in back of truck.  Worked great, slept in the sheets or on top depending on the weather.  Loved it.","733":"It\u2019s warm and the one I got was extra long so my feet don\u2019t hang out","734":"This is my second one. The comfortable is very warm","735":"Good value for the price! Perfect size for a blanket comforter","736":"This is possibly the best comforter I've ever purchased.....it literally wraps you in comfort and affords you a great nights sleep...I m very satisfied...great product!!!!","737":"Pleasantly surprised and very satisfied. You don\u2019t have to spend a fortune to sleep comfortably","738":"Bought for college dorm room. My other child is asking for a set too because it was so comfortable! Excellent material. great buy for the price. Will buy again.","739":"This is a very nice, comfortable and easy care comforter.  The selection of colors is amazing.  It looks and feels great.","740":"I needed something affordable and good quality. This comforter does not look cheap, despite its low price in comparison with more expensive ones.","741":"We love it very comfortable.","742":"The pockets feel like they they are gel filled giving an extra layer of comfort. Keeps me warm without the weight.Colors are true.","743":"This is perfect - not too large for the bed (since dorms put the dressers under the bed - not hanging too far down).  Warmth seems adequate but will not over-warm.","744":"I really like this comfort. Washed well and is very soft. It is a little heavier than I thought it would be but not uncomfortably hot. I keep my house pretty cool at night so it\u2019s fine for me.","745":"This is heavier than our usual comforters but it\u2019s so amazing. We love it!! It\u2019s soft and just makes you comfy when you\u2019re sleeping.","746":"The duvet was the perfect size. We were impressed with the softness, smoothness of the fabric and the weight. We will use this duvet as our comforter for summer weather.","747":"Its hard to find a good comforter these days. This is perfect! Heavy enougb to sooth but not suffocate, very soft seems to be good quality but havent washed it yet.","748":"My mom loves it. It soft and comfy.","749":"These aren't the thickest comforters, but for the price they are great. They are also effective at keeping you warm but not too hot. We have 2 in our house and I would absolutely purchase again.","750":"It is not heavy to sleep with, easy for one person to cover themselves. I love the color and the warmth that it provides!","751":"Nice quality comforter. I have a much warmer one for winter months but this seems perfect for spring, summer, fall.","752":"I like this because it is light weight yet warm at the same time.","753":"This blanket was comfortable!","754":"Beautiful","755":"Very happy with these sets. They are soft and exactly what I was looking for.","756":"The blanket is soft and very warm but it rips super easily. The second day we had it it ripped due to my dogs jumping on the bed. Needless to say it now has about 5 tears in it. Would not recommend if you have pets.","757":"I should have read all of the reviews before purchasing. I purchased this comforter in black. As another user mentioned, this comforter is definitely not black, but more of a charcoal gray color. It does not match any of my other sheets or bedding which is actually black, as you can clearly see in the picture.","758":"It\u2019s great!! So soft I love it! I wasn\u2019t sure at first it looked thin but it\u2019s actually soft and warm it\u2019s perfect for winter or summer","759":"Exactly what it is not a full set (didn\u2019t think it was) delivered faster then expected good purchase.","760":"Sent to my mother at 94 she knows a good blanket, she loves it.. got the blue color!","761":"Started off as a nice blanket and very warm.  After 2 washes the blanket started to fall apart as seen in the picture.","762":"exactly what was advertise","763":"Daughter loved the quilt","764":"My mom loved it keeps her very warm","765":"Love love love ..... the best comforter","766":"This is a soft, warm comforter and it washes well. It is a pretty blue","767":"Super soft and warm","768":"Its nice and comfy","769":"It's beautiful","770":"Good packing, good enough for my 6 year old.  I have no complaints I must say it\u2019s true to size and super soft !","771":"I am super pleased with this comforter and plan on ordering another. Soft, comfy, keeps you perfectly warm. Love it!","772":"Beautiful rich plum color. I bought a twin for a queen size air mattress and it\u2019s more than big enough. Very cozy and warm, but light enough for spring and summer too.  Glad I made this purchase!!","773":"Some blankets just hold in heat and humidity too much and this one is perfect! Cool enough that you can lay with it without being uncomfortable and heavy enough when you are underneath of it to keep you nice and toasty warm! I absolutely love it!","774":"Love it but do wish it was about 2 inches wider on each side. We bought a king for a king sized bed.  It doesn't quite cover the bottom edges of the sheet.  Amazed at it's warmth considering how light weight it is.","775":"Oh my!! Daughter loved the comforter set on her bed. She said the material is very soft. She even loves the color","776":"this is great, love it!stay safe and wear a mask, love ya!","777":"Love the dark green color and quality..took one star off cuz I have only washed it a couple times but I\u2019ve already noticed some piling on the comforter.","778":"Super comfortable and warm best cover ever.","779":"Vibrant color, good quality and very soft.  I will buy in other colors.","780":"The comforter is very neat and attractive.  It is warm and cozy on these cold winter nights without slipping and sliding off the bed.  The down does not mat or wad but remains even throughout the comforter.","781":"I've had this comforter for about a month now and love it. It's very soft and comfortable. Perfect weight-not too thick and heavy, and not cheap and light weight. The quality is surprisingly good at such a great price. It's held up so far despite the beating it takes from my cat. Besides the price and reviews the wide color selection drew me to this product and the coronet blue not only looks awesome but has been great at not attracting all the cat hair.","782":"Very surprised at the quality of this comforter set.  I ordered the red bed set and I love it!! The red color is very vibrant, very soft, and well made.","783":"I have one and is very warm light weight.","784":"Love this comforter! It is the perfect balance of warm and light weight. It fits our English King perfectly and hangs off all the edges with room to spare. Very affordable option without sacrificing quality.","785":"Very soft material","786":"Would recommend.","787":"So comfortable soft and warm.  Definitely worth the price. Also LOVE THE COLOR","788":"It's a nice looking comforter but after I slept on it lite white lint was everywhere.  I picked it off thinking it was my throw blanket but the more I slept on the more these white fibers can coming out. I wouldn't recommend this product","789":"For starters i ordered this for a queen matress cause i wanted it to drape of bed a certain way. This comforter is super comfy and has a great feel to the touch. It is very black even after being washed twice. No stitching problems or blemishes. Will by another","790":"Light weight, comfy for the granddaughter","791":"It's obvious that the sewing job is not that great; there are threads here and there, but seems like it will hold up for a while and very comfortable. Sham fits extremely well. Very nice on the color.","792":"It\u2019s a great comforter! My grandson loved it!","793":"Amazing. Exactly what I wanted. Worth it","794":"Super comfortable, super light weight but warm. Good price!","795":"I am so happy with this.  I love the color, the size is perfect, it's well made.  And you can't beat the price.","796":"When comparing the price to other comforters you know your not getting the best of best but like shouldn\u2019t it last more then week? It started to come apart less then a week. This is one of the biggest scam I\u2019ve ever seen. Save your money and buy from a more reputable company.","797":"After 2-3 washes, the material inside the cover started to come out (see pics that show the white material bleeding out of the red cover).  This  occurred at or around 6 months, which was past their warranty period of 30 days.  No exceptions made by the seller, so be aware.","798":"It's nice but It's very thin. I bought it for my dorm. Had to order a weighted blanket and a sherpa because it didn't keep me warm in the winter","799":"Ordered the red color - it is more of a light burgundy. Still a great color. Fabric is very soft. Stitching looks good. Pillow sham fabric is very thin. Comforter does not feel too heavy.","800":"The bed sheet has very deep pockets and it stays on for the roughest sleeper. The comforter is soft and warm. Great product for a great price.","801":"Warm, soft and durable.","802":"My husband enjoys this set","803":"this is very soft. i bought a xl twin on accident instead of a full but it till worked out. it is a true light grey. it is flat when you get the package which worried me but when you open it, it does expand and puff up.","804":"Bought this set in grey for granddaughter heading off for first year of college.  Machine wash& dry was great; color & weight of material good.  Should have a long life span based on what I've seen so far.","805":"Good quality, washes well, soft, warm but light weight. Good buy","806":"very nice, put it in the dry then on my full  size bed, I have to  put my cats blanket over the comforter for her to sleep on,  oh boy","807":"Will update later if anything changes, but right out of the package it was lovely.  Extremely soft, the alternative down is cushy and the comforter is weighted just so it's not too light or too heavy.","808":"These comforters are so amazing! They are soft, warm and light weight. The material is fabulous. I haven't washed them yet so I hope they wash well but so far I am impressed","809":"It is big and fluffy!","810":"This comforter is decent. It is very warm, comfy and reasonably priced. I purchased the beige colored one in July 2019 and the only complaint I have is that it attracts so much lint. Since I got a light colored one, it seems more prominent and sometimes makes the comforter look dirty. I constantly go over it with a lint roller because sometimes I can't take how linty and unclean it looks.","811":"I bought this comforter, thought it was amazing. Until the very first time I put it in the washer, it completely fell apart. I put out pieces and pieces of fabric and stuffing on it out of my washer. Had no problem with any loads of laundry. Very unsatisfied and would not recommend buying this.","812":"This looks lightweight and it feels lightweight, but I can't use it most nights. Even in the dead of winter I was kicking it off. Pretty soft and wrinkle free though.","813":"so soft and cozy","814":"I wasn't to sure about this when I ordered it, but when we got it, I loved it. Very soft and comfy. My husband loves it as he is always the one who is cold. It is to heavy for me.","815":"Liked the Color and the weight.","816":"My niece picked this for one of her birthday gifts and she loved it.","817":"Matches comforter from Bare","818":"The size is perfect and the material is soft. It arrived quick too! Happy with the product.","819":"This is very warm I kick it off every night.  but its soft and comfty","820":"It's on my bed. I am in love with the blanket.","821":"The black color is a very off looking light black.  Not a very solid dark black color.","822":"It was a gift for my granddaughter, who just had twin boys.  She was pleased with the blanket and said it was so soft.","823":"Got this for my son to use in college! I was very pleased with my purchase.","824":"Very comfortable! My son loves it, and it\u2019s easy to make up your bed. Very comfortable comforter. Pillows sheets are regular.","825":"I love the quilt since I\u2019ve started using it but it a warm blanket compared to my other ones. But very soft and comfy.","826":"I love this comforter. This is actually my second Bare comforter (due to my dog). These comforters are light yet warm and super cozy. Will buy again!","827":"Good quality for price light weight and sized well. Looks pretty on bed.","828":"Loved it until I washed it for the first time. It was torn and stuffing was falling out. Getting a replacement hopefully doesn't do the same.","829":"I love this comforter. I mean everything about it. The price, quality, softness, and look are excellent.","830":"Unable rate the ease in cleaning . I only used for a week. I feel that the King is a nice size and roomy . Very comfy on our bed.King shams look nice. Taupe color is perfect as shown.","831":"Purchased for my granddaughter..wonderful quality;very soft and the color is gorgeous","832":"this comforter is magnificent. It is very soft and lightweight. I wake up being too warm and this is coming from someone who is always cold! Absolutely would recommend.","833":"Good looking","834":"I love my new comforter. The color is brilliant and it\u2019s light weight as well as soft .","835":"I am in love with this new comforter. It is sooo snuggly. It is warmer than I expected! I will likely not be able to use it in the summer but it is working great for the winter.","836":"warm and soft. Nice color too","837":"Love it wish I could order all colors fits my king size bed perfect buy","838":"I love this comforter. Amazing value. Lightweight and soft. Color exactly as shown. I would recommend to anyone.","839":"Ordered black but it\u2019s clearly not. Pictured next to a dark grey pillow case.","840":"Great comforter. Recommend buying this product.","841":"When my son opened the package for the blanket bugs fell out of it alive. Turns out these bugs are bed bugs and created an infestation in my sons room! Luckily it\u2019s localized to his room but costed me 3 grand to get this taken care of!  Never buy products from this brand again!","842":"Issues with cotton coming out after washing it","843":"Something about the material doesn't allow moisture out, so if you tend to sweat at night you will wake up wet.","844":"Beautiful","845":"It is lightweight and easy to handle. Size is generous and I\u2019m enjoying using it. Haven\u2019t washed yet but looks like it\u2019s made well  Would purchase again","846":"It really could have had more fluff in it.  It is as flat as the fleece blanket under it. Warmth level average. Would be hard pressed to call it a down comforter seems definitely more your average comforter.","847":"Got the job done.","848":"So comfortable and soft","849":"Got it for an 11 year old girl\u2019s bed used every other weekend. She likes it. Her room is pretty cold, so it keeps her warm.","850":"I didn\u2019t think this comforter would be warm enough because it\u2019s soo lightweight, but I was wrong. Not only is it so comfy it\u2019s also warm! Really love it so far.","851":"Very nice comforter. I like it.","852":"Not as warm as expected","853":"Very nice worth the money","854":"I totally love my comforter, it's so warm and light. The material is very soft. The only problem is I don't want to leave my bed now.I highly recommend this for the cold weather. Looks nice as a bed spread too.","855":"Not fluffy like the picture and color does not match. Not worth the $53 for the comforter or two pillow cases.","856":"My daughter is a hot sleeper so I wanted something that will keep her warm but not sweaty warm, this is perfect for her. Comfy feel too, works great in her new room.","857":"It's nice and keeps me warm made good no flaws","858":"Washed and dried beautifully . Very comfortable . Good value for the money .","859":"I bought for my dorm this year and it was worth the money. Its warm enough to keep you from getting cold but it isn't scorching at all. Also I washed it and it washed really well, not tears, clumping, snagging it works really well. Also the fabrics feels amazing and is super soft. I suggest this comforter especially for and college students","860":"Nice for the price","861":"So far so good!! Great price and quality.","862":"I bought one for myself and one for my son, and both of us agree that this comforter is warmer than our goose down comforter. They fit well on both beds, and are easy to wash.","863":"This comforter was perfect, the softness, the weight, the color (tan)!!!  I bought a King to go on a Queen bed because I wanted the extra inches and it's perfect.  I will be buying another one also!!","864":"Product arrived promptly and nicely packaged. It is very warm, but light weight. For the price, I feel it was a good buy.","865":"So this product is super soft. Very warm and plush. My biggest issue was with the stitching. There were some errors in the quilting that I had to cut and burn strings on that I\u2019m hoping doesn\u2019t lead to bigger issues later.","866":"The color is a perfect Taupe.  I'm using it on my King Size bed and it's the right size. Extra wide.","867":"awesome product !! arrived on time!!  \ud83d\udc4d","868":"Fits bed perfectly","869":"Perfect for what I was looking for! Super great price for the quality","870":"Love the color. it is so rich. The alternate down is extremely warm, but light weight. With my 600-count cotton sheets, it is very comfortable, yet soft.","871":"I love how comfortable and warm this is but I'm super disappointed in the quality. After only a couple of weeks of having it, the stuffing started coming out of it in random spots. Any little snag will cause the stuffing to just spill out. It also gets VERY linty.","872":"Me encanto! Es ligera, comoda y calientita, mi hijo esta fascinado con este edredon. Y pienso pedir uno para mi, nada mas siento que falta mas variedad de colores pero todo perfecto \ud83d\udc4c","873":"I love this comforter! It's extremely well made for the price, there are no loose threads or holes or anything else of concern. It's very fluffy, soft, and has no worse smell than if you bought it at a store. Shipped quickly too, it took less than sweet to arrive. I would definitely recommend buying!","874":"Very nice","875":"Item as described. Fast shipping. Haven't actually slept with it yet as it is in our motor home.","876":"I liked everything about these comforters except the color! I purchased a red & a blue one. I was really hoping for the bright red color depicted in the picture, but it actually is closer to a maroon color. The blue comforter wasn't a bright blue either. It's a faded blue (it looks as if I've run it through the wash a couple times already).","877":"Very comfortable very warm","878":"A great value for the price!","879":"I purchased this for my son to use in his dorm at 48.7519\u00b0 N, 122.4787\u00b0 W. He already had a wool blanket and cotton one. He folded up the others and placed them for decorations and began using this full time on his bed. Warm and snuggly. Thank you.","880":"This is the best comforter! My 3 year old son loves how comfy it is. Easy to wash and made well. Plan on ordering 2 more to use inside duvet covers! You will love this comforter!","881":"I ordered the \u201cblack\u201d set that\u2019s really a dark charcoal gray color which is why I had to give it 4 stars. Other than that it\u2019s perfect.","882":"Absolute softest comforter I\u2019ve ever owned. 100% satisfied and will order this one again. And I may have to, as my son threw up all over my current one. Having trouble getting it clean...","883":"Warm and pretty.","884":"The color is great.  It is so light weight and does not slide all over the place when you sleep.","885":"Love this brand!","886":"This comforter is incredibly soft and puts you right to sleep. We love it so much that we bought one for every bedroom in our house. Great quality and price point isn't terrible either","887":"Super soft and fluffy. This is seriously the most luxurious comfortable I\u2019ve ever owned. GREAT product. Very well made, no loose threads or any flaws.","888":"I inadvertently ordered two of these and the Amazon representative graciously cancelled the second one.  After I received the quilt, I found its warmth and weight perfect for my drafty bedroom.  I decided that a wanted a second one in a contrasting color, but was inable to find one to complement the first so I ordered a second quilt in the same color.  For me the heavier weight is perfect in a drafty home.","889":"I love the way it feels and it keeps me warm.","890":"Highly annoyed that after one wash this comforter started to release the cotton from the inside. Not well made at all. The material is soft and that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 0. Best for a one time use I guess.","891":"Love it, nice color, worth the price. Not falling apart like others have said in reviews. It\u2019s unusually warm, I sometimes wake up in a sweat. Perfect for cold winter nights.","892":"Pleasantly surprised at how nice it is!","893":"Good versatile product .","894":"I purchased the Blue Comforter,the color is as advertised,fit twin as advertised. Nice and cozy. Happy with this purchase.","895":"Amazing as described great value for the money super soft washed and dried well for my 11 year old son's birthday great for a kid's room or guest room.","896":"Very comfortable, not to hot for its size and thickness. Great balance for room decor, just hopes it holds its colorfulness","897":"I just received this blanket and haven't washed it yet. I like the softness of the fabric. The color and size were as expected. The blanket is a little lighter and thinner than I hoped for. I am adjusting my review after using the blanket for a week. Despite the fact that it is light and thin, it is definitely worm enough for New York winter.","898":"Blanket is soft and warm, pillow cases for a twin size bed fits better for a queen size pillow. Would definitely buy again!","899":"Solid comforter - good value, washes well, color is great! (Purchases navy blue)Wrinkles easily.","900":"Very warm and great.","901":"Very soft. Has a little bit of weight to it, but very nice and warm.","902":"I bought the oversized king for my queen size bed and it fits perfectly.  I don't even need a bed skirt.  Plus, its really soft and warm.  I highly recommend this product.","903":"Nice and warm.  Soft and cuddly.  Big enough for my King.","904":"This is a poor and bad quality comforter!! Buy something else!! I used it for a few days and the fluff is already coming out of it and when you pull to get rid of, it pulls more!! Very POOR and bad quality!!!","905":"This is one of the best comforters ever!!!!I find it hard to get out of bed because it's soooo comfortable","906":"A grown up look for a young adult","907":"Love this comforter. Its super soft and warm. If you have to wash it you have to take it to the cleaners because it won't fit in a standard washer. Overall we love it and recommend this comforter set.","908":"Very soft, perfect fit for my Cali king size bed.","909":"Great weight and feel. Not too warm either as we are in the Southwest where it is already 90+ in April. Fills out our king size duvet cover perfectly, and is extremely soft on its own if you were to sleep with it alone!","910":"Using this in a spare bedroom. Size is perfect. It\u2019s everything it was described.","911":"Very soft!","912":"Not too hot. Perfect for California weather. Really easy to wash at home!","913":"It is very nice my daughter loves it and she says is soft.","914":"A great soft comforter! Very happy with my choice, much better quality than I had expected for the price!","915":"Great quality and doesn't fade. Very comfortable. Will definitely buy again.","916":"I will give this comforter credit, it is soft and it is WARM!! I have only had this comforter for the Winter season, I have doubts it can be used for all seasons. It is so warm, it gives me the sweats. It runs borderline hot. Could be a little heavy for the warmer seasons.","917":"My duvets from IKEA  fit perfectly on it. I also love the pillow cases because it klgave my favorite pillows a new look!!","918":"Great quality great price, very happy and would definitely buy again!!","919":"love it","920":"Very soft and fluffier than anticipated. Not noisy or crinkly sounding at all. Generously sized. Very happy with product and seller.","921":"First of all, I bought this comforter because of the color, it most closely matched the tapestry print of my sofa.  So far this comforter fits the bill.","922":"Pretty soft, light weight but still has a little weight to it, which is good since I run a high body temp. Slept through the night and didn't wake up cold or overheated. I like it, just know the black is not dark black more like a charcoal black.","923":"Amazing blanket. Completely worth the money. Brilliant color. Feels like a cloud. Extremely disappointed that they are out of stock on everything else bc I was ready to buy more in different sizes and the weighted blankets. Very sad about this.","924":"This comforter is so nice and dried much easier in my front load dryer then my other comforter","925":"This blanket is fantastic.  It's comfortable, warm, and just feels good to throw over your shoulder.","926":"Super soft and perfect in weight!","927":"I thought the color would be dark like the picture.  My husband calls it army green, but I decided on avocado.  It works with the pillows so it is okay.","928":"It's a warm comforter but don't expect to look exactly like the picture.....you would need to spend alot more money for that look. I like it just fine but not a 5 star product.","929":"We love our new comforter. I was really surprised at how soft and comfortable it is. It\u2019s thicker than I expected but too hot.","930":"Used for elderly man smaller than bed so no trouble tucking inLovely and sot and smooth. Comes out of dryer like newI love bare home products","931":"Fits double bed perfectly.  Not sure it is large enough for queen.  Very nice material and well made.","932":"You get what you pay for. Flimsy material and i know that after 6 washes it will unravel ; after 6 drys it'll all shrink.","933":"My favorite set of sheets","934":"Very soft. Great weight. Great price. Would have kept it if the color was the same as it looked online. Picture definitely looks like a navy blue, but in person it is brighter - kind a cross between navy and royal. Still pretty, but didn't match our decor.","935":"Very disappointed.  I saw great reviews so I bought it.  Fabric is very rough and the stuffing moves all around.","936":"Perfect","937":"Super fast shipment and great product!","938":"Great quality for the price nice and soft an comfy. My kids loved it an I love it to.","939":"Lovely comforter for the price.","940":"This comforter is so great, soft and comfy. I would like to buy another set but, the colors that I want to buy is not available in full size. Please have more colors in full size available so I can buy more.","941":"Good quality","942":"Perfect right out of the package. Substantial enough to keep the user warm, but light enough, it's not stifling","943":"I was surprised at what a great comforter this was! Super soft and fluffy!","944":"Nice and fluffy","945":"My son loves this! He said it is really warm.","946":"Very disappointed, only 6 months and tufts of stuffing coming out like a feather might.","947":"It came quickly and really like the feel from it. Glad I bought it!","948":"Got these for my dorm room, looks great and keep me warm. No holes or defects upon arrival. Love these!","949":"Love the color fits like a good twin","950":"Soft and nice \ud83d\udc4d","951":"Bought this comforter for a teen. They loved it. Great Purchase!","952":"As noted super soft and a great material feel. A good comforter if you're looking for a nice comforter that isn't bulky.  At the price, I don't know if you can beat it!","953":"This is a wonderful duvet insert! It's plenty big, washed up nicely & it's fluffy. Looking forward to using this. Very happy with the seller and will be more than happy to buy from them again!","954":"I absolutely love this product!! It\u2019s so soft and fits my bed perfectly","955":"These comforters are super high quality.  Warm, soft, well made and the twin XL is really a true XL size.","956":"Very lightweight but warm down comforter! Came packaged nicely and I love the color","957":"Love it!! Doesn\u2019t loose shape after washing","958":"I love how simple and weighted this comforter is. Its the perfect pressure for a good nights sleep. I love the grey color. I washed it in washing machine and no threads came apart. GREAT","959":"My son is hot-natured so comforters usually overheat him.  Not a problem for this comforter.  He loves to sleep under it and does so quite comfortably.  The look is just what I wanted for his room too.","960":"the comforter set is not only lovely, but it is warm and was very affordable..I am truly enjoying it and it looks great..","961":"Amazing set, soft and chemical free which was important to my family. Washes up wonderful.","962":"This is a great comforter at a great price. Very soft and breathable and warm","963":"Excellent, soft, mid-weight comforter at a good price. Full\/Queen is a generous 92\" X 90\". From Bare Home mine DID come with two pillow shams, unlike experience of some reviewers. Can't comment on what it will be like after numerous washings, but right now it's a nice dark, but not dull, blue, I won't buy a comforter that doesn't have at least rows of vertical stitching to deter fiberfill bunching, (or even better stitched squares like this one), but that feature is difficult to find in a reasonably priced one with a nice pattern, so I livened up this solid-colored one with a velvet throw also found on Amazon. (In pic the throw is folded over one square's width on both edges, but I think I'm going to trim and re-hem it since I'm focused on it's decorative value, not on using it as a throw. One made from a home deco fabric might be better since, at least right mow, the throw is shedding a bit.)","964":"It works.","965":"This light weight blanket is a must! So comfortable and fits our cal king just right!","966":"I absolutely love this comforter. I was hesitant to buy but it\u2019s so soft, comfy, not to heavy but keeps you warm.","967":"I really like this comforter. I just wish there was an extra large California King that hung to the floor. This goes about 4 inches off the sides of the bed.","968":"Plain, simple navy blue, comfy. Just what I was looking for, something that enhanced existing items in the room without clashing with them.","969":"Was doubtful once it arrived all shrink wrapped and what not but to my surprise its wonderful! Very warm yet cool at the same time. Love it!!","970":"When I washed it it ripped in spots, this is the second time I have washed it, not happy about this.I like the fact that they are light weight and warm!I don\u2019t have them on children beds, they are on my husband and mine.  Thank you","971":"Wow amazing quality!! So soft and comfortableVery well made! Buy it you won\u2019t regret","972":"My daughter picked this set herself & loves it. Just what she wanted. Just FYI, only comes with the comforter and a standard pillow case.","973":"My Son loves his new comforter. He gets hot a lot so I wanted to find a comforter for him that was light but comfortable for him at the same time. This comforter does the job and it's also super soft. Great find!","974":"This comforter was for my 16 yo son. I am now looking for one for my daughter and my husband and I.  It is soooo soft and feels great! It is a bit warm for summertime use, but I'll turn the air down, lol! Haven't washed yet...","975":"It is cute","976":"I wasn't sure what to expect with some of the reviews on here, but I couldn't be more pleased.  It is a very soft fabric, washes well and keeps us warm.  Love it!","977":"Love how soft it is and keeps you the perfect temp.","978":"This comforter matches the online description.  It fits perfectly on my California king bed.  So glad I bought it.  My husband loves it too.","979":"It feels and looks great!","980":"I loved this comforter however I noticed stuffing all over the place. Come to find out there\u2019s a hole and the stuffing is coming out. I\u2019d give it 5 if it weren\u2019t for that.","981":"His very soft and comfortable yet somewhat durable","982":"For the price, this comforter is super nice. I have no complaint about it--if you're like me and you're coming into college with very little money and nothing except for too many plants, books, and skincare items, you will be 100% satisfied with this comforter. For reference, I live in high elevation mountains, and this comforter plus sheets are enough to keep me warm.","983":"Sturdy blanket","984":"I use this for my kid\u2019s bed. Soft and comfortable!","985":"This comforter is really nice, comfortable and soft. So glad I purchased it.","986":"Perfect fit","987":"Super soft and cozy! Little bit of luxury!","988":"Love, love this color!","989":"I bought the black and it was NOT BLACK. It was a ugly shade between grey and black. Horrible.  I learned my colors at 2 years old and even someone colorblind could see the difference. Did not even take it out of the package but the material also had that shiny look to it and did not look as soft.","990":"Perfect for my bedroom.  Easy to match accessories with.","991":"This far exceeded my expectations, the feel and quality are excellent. I love that the color is consistent on both sides. May buy another color for another room.","992":"Alot fluffier than I expected which is good! Well made and looks expensive.","993":"Nice quality! Wonderful color of grey blue. Comfortable and a good fit.","994":"Not to hot, not to cold, just right, I keep my bedroom at 67F..this is great.","995":"My second purchased in recent months, well made, excellent value, also purchased several sheet sets last year and again this year, no need to go to Bed Bath & Beyond any longer, Thank You !!","996":"This comforter is super soft and exactly as featured.","997":"Only had it a day so can\u2019t write about the durability. Feels great. Is smaller than my last comfortable though. Length is fine but it\u2019s not wide enough. There\u2019s only about 6 inches extra on each side.","998":"It is pretty and soft just not the size\/length I needed, Otherwise they will do until I find another set more fitting..","999":"This was an Angel Tree gift. Since I did not open or use, i have no idea how it feels or washes.  It was a lighter shade of red than I expected.","1000":"Usually I need 3 blankets to sleep in order to stay warm, last night I only needed this blanket and I slept SO WELL! Its very soft and comfortable. Cant beat the price for such great quality!","1001":"looks great!","1002":"Very pretty and soft.","1003":"Nice and love it","1004":"light weight but warm great color I have the coffee color but my mother has lite blue and the colors are true to the picture","1005":"The comforter is fantastic! But, wasn\u2019t it supposed to come with two pillow cases? Mine didn\u2019t \ud83d\ude2d","1006":"I bought these and I am very pleased with them.  Great feel on the skin and color is rich and royal blue which doesn't fade and keeps its beautiful color after washing.  Recommend this!","1007":"Extremely soft, perfect temp., Never too hot or too cold. Beautiful color. Good quality.","1008":"Very warm and comfortable","1009":"Bought this for my son and he loves it. Super comfy and warm! Will be buying more.","1010":"Awesome","1011":"The first one I received looked like it had been repacked. I requested a second one and it was packed better.","1012":"I've just bought the comforter so I can't comment on its durability, but the weight is nice and the stitching is solid. I washed it as soon as it arrived and it's in perfect condition.","1013":"Nice color combo but wrinkles don't fall out very easily. Would not but again.","1014":"love the color and softness of product","1015":"My bed now rivals most 5 star hotels. Love it!","1016":"Love this my husband can't sleep under heavy cover but is so lightweight. Now we're both happy.","1017":"Beautiful looking and feeling.Great addition to my bedroom. Very comfortable","1018":"great","1019":"Super comfortable and lightweight. I really like the comforter.","1020":"Great comforter!","1021":"Soft definitely. No pillow came in mine, only the pillowcase. I couldn\u2019t tell from the details or reviews if a pillow was supposed to come or not. Fits my twin bed nicely but now I have an extra sham pillowcase with no pillow in it.","1022":"We bought the twin and use it as a throw.  Just the right weight.  Well made, soft, hasn't pilled after a year and a few washings.  Love it!","1023":"This comforter is great right out of the box. It is a bit heavy, but I do like my comforters with some weight to them. The feel is quite nice, with some comforters you can feel the feathers or whatever material used, with this one, it's just soft. No weird textures. Stiching is quite nice, and it fit my queen size bed nicely. Would recommend for a decntly priced comforter.","1024":"This is a very nice feeling comforter and worth the buy.","1025":"Great pick.","1026":"Heavier than expected, so not lightweight, but amazing otherwise.","1027":"This is a great product especially for the price. It is for my daughter's college apartment bedroom so I wasn't looking for a super high quality item but I got one!","1028":"comforter set is good","1029":"So far so good holding up great. Keeps me warm no problems since i started using it the day it arrived","1030":"Great purchase","1031":"LOVE this comforter!!

It\u2019s soft and warm and I will buy more as gifts!","1032":"I got the bedding to replace my annual bedding for a christmas themed one and it matched my expectations!","1033":"Wonderful comforter at a great price. Very soft and just the right weight. Highly recommend.","1034":"Oversized king comforter, awesome!! Usually they barely fit and need to be perfectly placed on bed, this oversized comforter is the best ever. Fits as it should, soft, warm and cozy.","1035":"as advertised","1036":"I love the comforter, but I wish it was a little bit larger (I did order Kingsize).  My bed sits up pretty high.Thank you, though.  Maybe there is a size larger?","1037":"I love the color of this set, it goes perfectly. However, it is SMALL. I have a queen bed and ordered the king\/cal king and it barely fits.","1038":"Bought this for my son for his new house.......it was just what he was looking for. Very nice quality for an excellent price.","1039":"Was skeptical about purchasing online but love this blanket!! Great quality. Super soft and comfy.","1040":"Great comforter. At a great price. Soft yet light weight","1041":"Very lightweight.  Washed beautifully, already had a spill\ud83e\udd74.  Wished for a little more warmth but overall, a good buy for the money.","1042":"Soft,light and pretty. Fast Shipping!","1043":"Love this comforter, it\u2019s light with just the right softness.","1044":"This was order for my daughter she loves the color and how soft and comfortable it is.

It is very warm as well.","1045":"Bought for a gift and my sister loves it. It's very comfy and soft.","1046":"Love this comforter set. Second time ordering. Pan on getting more. Its affordable, soft, great quality and well package.","1047":"Nice","1048":"Love this cover all in all. It is heavy and weighs you down.  I live down south so this cover kept me hot. But amazing cover.","1049":"I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting a high quality comforter but I am very pleased with this. It was weighted, soft and very nicely made. One of my favorite purchases.","1050":"The product itself is fine. However, it came stained on one side.","1051":"Kids love them fresh out of the package. Wish they were a little bit softer. Great quality for the price.","1052":"When my son first opened this comforter he was disappointed it was not real down.  Once he used it he loved it.  Also for a college apartment it was much more practical.","1053":"I got these for my kids and it\u2019s worth for your money since I got it as deal of the day","1054":"Nice","1055":"Larger than imagined. More of a winter or colder climate comforter.  Light weight, and soft. I'm currently using it now in early summer, which it is too warm for, unless you have a good tower fan. Still 5 stars, I love it.","1056":"This was a great purchase. The comforter is soft and comfortable. It is a little warm for warm weather. I would suggest only use in winter.","1057":"This bed covering is as advertised and arrived on time.","1058":"Quality was great!! Was a Christmas gift for one of my resident at work. She loved it!!!!","1059":"Love it!!!!!!","1060":"Love this comforter. I switched up for a boho decor in my bedroom. It matched perfectly with my tapestry.I love this comforter because it\u2019s large which keeps me comfy but it\u2019s not heavy so I don\u2019t sweat.It did come with an odor but that to be expected from a warehouse. After a wash it was gone.","1061":"Very nice, soft and comfortable.","1062":"Tore up very quickly and rarely slept on","1063":"Best blanket ever","1064":"Nice comforter","1065":"Haven\u2019t even washed it and it\u2019s ripped all around the edges with stuffing falling out of it. I was so excited for this product and now it\u2019s just one more disappointing product I have to return now. Definitely not worth the almost $50 after processing fees","1066":"Absolute comfort!!","1067":"I\u2019ll be honest, I could LOVE this set and give it 5 stars but I am very disappointed with the size! I ordered the California King and it doesn\u2019t fully cover my king bed and all I have is a normal mattress no extra mattress pad or pillow top mattress so I am disappointed that it\u2019s to small","1068":"This is the perfect comforter.  Lightweight and comfortable.  Very nice quality and the price was reasonable!  Very happy with this purchase","1069":"Probably one of my favorite comforters, fluffy, soft, comfortable. The only problem I have with it is it\u2019s water retention. drying this is near impossible and I do not know why but it just holds the water","1070":"Love it","1071":"Excellent good quality love the color!","1072":"Very soft, very cozy.  I am especially impressed with the price and the quality.","1073":"I've had two for almost 3 years now. I use them everyday. They're comfy and soft. They are durable and hold up after washing.","1074":"Gorgeous comforter. Made very well! It has a little weight to it as well. I bought an XL Twin for my college daughter. She loves it!  I would highly recommend this brand!","1075":"The light weight softness and warmth of the comforter is absolutely amazing. After a hard days work I look forward to wrapping myself up in my Bare Home Comforter, it's like grandma's hug and warm embrace.","1076":"This blanket is great. Soft, not too heavy, and holds  in heat very well! Would buy another one if I had an extra bed.","1077":"There is nothing I dislike about this comforter. The softness is amazing, the color is vibrant and the price is awesome. I never purchased an oversized queen before, I love this size I\u2019ll never buy another regular size queen.","1078":"This quilt is very very soft and cozy and very warm.  I plan on getting another down the road.","1079":"Love this comforter","1080":"Very warm and soft while being. Light weight. Perfect length.

Comforter washed and dried easily in a standard machine.","1083":"Very soft and perfect for any season.","1084":"Great price for the quality","1085":"I dislike that it is made in China. I had specifically looked for a comforter made in USA. The advertisement said it was but the tag on the product says China. However, the price is reasonable and the comforter met my needs.","1086":"Love it, warm and extra long!","1087":"Warm light weight breathable very comfortable","1088":"I like that its very soft. Thin but real. Warm. I washed it lot nothing came apart. Great comforter.

The color is beautiful.","1094":"Super soft and my daughter loves it!","1095":"Everything is great!!","1096":"I was skeptical about this comforter after seeing mixed reviews. It\u2019s soft and so comfy. It washed up great and dried perfectly. I would suggest washing it when you get it because it fluffs up after it\u2019s washed.","1097":"Says it\u2019s a comforter \u201cset\u201d but only comes with a blanket. Not happy with this purchase at all bc now I need to buy everything else separate but blanket does feel very nice and I will be keeping it.","1098":"love this comforter ! i ordered 2 and they are so big and soft and warm and just perfect !","1099":"I bought this for my son for his dorm. I love the color. There are many shades of navy and this is a more vibrant blue. It looks great on his bed and fits well. The item was shipped promptly and was packed well. I would highly recommend","1100":"It\u2019s so comfortable i lost my job because it was worth it to stay tucked in rather than go to work","1101":"We searched everywhere in town for a red comforter and couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. This one was perfect. Super fluffy and soft.","1102":"Perfectly sized if you\u2019re always reaching for the blanket at night because someone has it all on their side. Ha!

Easy to wash and perfect for year round weather. Warmer than it looks.","1111":"Nice warm and soft blanket. Great for winter time.","1112":"Bought king size comforter for my queen size bed, as I like extra coverage on the sides both when its made and when I am sleeping.  Fits perfectly.  The grey color is just right and the fabric is super soft.  Love it!","1113":"Bought as a gift so don't know too much but it seemed very nice.","1114":"Worth the price","1115":"Rich color and quality fabric.  This comforter set really enhanced the space.","1116":"This set is what it is, nothing fancy just a basic lightweight comforter.  Purchased for my daughters room. She likes it, no complaints. I have none either. Price was good being that I purchase a new one every year.","1117":"My kids love these blankets. I\u2019ve washed them multiple times with no issues. Still as soft as when I opened the package.","1118":"Stitching isn't very good. There was already a small hole along the edge where the stitching tore. And of course pretty much nothing is ever like the pictures, so that was to be expected. But it's warm, comfortable, and still decently plush.","1119":"So soft! Thick but light weight. Gives my bed an elegant clean look. Fresh enough when its hot and warm enough when its cold!","1120":"Thin, fair and quality comforter. For the price, I\u2019m happy with the purchase.","1121":"Grandchildren and they loved them","1122":"Ordered 3\/11\/21, washed for the first time 4\/21\/21 and it came a part in 3 places.

It fits perfect, is fluffy, and the material is soft to the touch.","1125":"They are lovely. Soft, light weight, easily washed and dry beautifully.","1126":"The color is lovely and the material is comfortable and cushioning.  This is def not a substitute for down, but it still keeps you warm and is comfortable.  Nice value purchase.","1127":"Sooooo soft and comfy!!!!","1128":"This comforter is so so soft, fluffy, and comfy. Love it!","1129":"This is a very nice feeling, solid comforter.  No bunching when I washed it. The royal blue color however, is much, much lighter and brighter than I expected based on the picture and description.","1130":"Beautiful color and feel. My only wish is that it had been a bit bigger to hang over the edges of the bed more. I should have looked more thorough at the description.","1131":"It\u2019s very very nice.  Looks beautiful on our bed.  The pillow shams are a little disappointing.  They look more like pillow cases with a ruffle","1132":"Good product ! I live in Florida, so it\u2019s great for our weather. Last night was 42 F and it was warm under the comforter. It\u2019s soft and light.","1133":"I like the color but I think I need the dust ruffle I\u2019m going to order today I haven\u2019t put it on yet","1134":"Better than expected. Very soft.

I hope the company considers the other less than ideal reviews they have received recently and can come up with a solution!","1151":"The cotton is coming out of the comforter","1152":"breathable, very soft and comfortable, but still enough weight that you feel something on you.

Update: If you are buying this for a teenage boy...Don't! The fabric doesn't breathe at all, my sons room reeks of \"teenage boy sweat\" after only a few days.

Perfect size for a twin or twin XL.","3024":"Good product.","3025":"Very warm and very thick for price","3026":"The only issue I have is that when I removed it from the packaging there were small spots of white.  At first I thought it was flecks of tissue but when they wouldn't be removed I saw that it was as though it had been sprinkled with bleach.  It has to be noted there are not LOTS of flecks but they are definitely there.  Since I'm in ill health I have no visitors so no one but me will see the spots.

Nicely made, very happy with purchase!","3134":"The quality of the comforter was very good, but the taupe color was much darker than represented and expected.  I returned them (two), and the return postage (my out-of-pocket) was the equivalent of one comforter.  Expensive lesson learned.","3135":"Great item.  Fair price.

Contacted seller, but, never heard back.","3152":"Loved it!","3153":"I sent this to a friend who is staying in a dorm type environment. The description says \"Down Alternative Premium Ultra-Soft Comforter Set\" and I was under the impression that a comforter set came with the fitted sheet. This did not. I didn't read in the description box to see what would come because I was certain that all comforter sets came with the sheets. I guess I was wrong so that's my fault. It did come with a pillow case. Halfways satisfied with ordering this product.","3154":"I love how soft and light it is","3155":"Very nice and lightweight, but warm for AC in Florida.  Beautiful color!","3156":"Good summer and winter comforter.  Keeps the bed looking neat without using a bed spread.

Like a outside of a sleeping bag","3158":"love it!","3159":"Super soft!!","3160":"Nice comforter","3161":"This set feels nice and soft, and you can definitely tell there is down in it. My only complaint is that the coral is more of an orange color, so it doesn't match the picture quite as well as I was expecting. A good quality product though!","3162":"very happy with the comforter, it was exactly as described and fit the twin bed perfectly","3163":"It's so warm & fluffy. Even though I washed it, it's still warm and fluffy: would definitely recommend to anyone","3164":"Excellent product and the process couldn't be easier.","3165":"Thank you","3166":"Has a strong, offensive odor.  Have washed and dried it approximately 15 times and let it sit out in a room for about a month but it is still intolerable.  Two stars for generous fill, perfect length, and very pretty taupe color.  But will be giving away to Salvation Army due to the odor.\n\nIvy Union Premium Down Alternative Comforter Set Twin XL Extra Long \/ Twin (Taupe)","3167":"what I expected","3168":"stitching started coming undone shortly after I received this, not happy at all with the product","3169":"This is horrible mine came with all the stuffing hanging out on the top of comforter and threads all lose and hanging also plus it's so light weight! Worst purchase on Amazon!","3170":"I ordered this for the color and the fact it said it was light weight. My problem is ALL the stuffing coming through. So there is white stuff all over the comforter. It makes it look bad. I would not buy this item again for that reason.","3171":"Worked great.","3172":"Good, but I thought the price could have been lower.","3173":"When it came in, it was dirty, so I had to wash it. It faded a weird color, and doesn't look nearly as dark as it is presented, but it serves its function. It fits perfectly on my Twin XL","3174":"Nice!","3175":"Not heirloom-quality bedding, but great for a dorm room. It looks sturdy, though we haven't literally put it through the wringer yet. Will update the post if we feel differently after many washes.","3176":"Soft and beautiful ! Love it!","3177":"Beautiful color, very warm. machine washable and dryable. Have yet to test it against an Iowan winter though, will most likely be needing an additional electric blanket.","3178":"Amazing!","3179":"Great price good quality!!!!!!","3180":"Yes. Perfect for college","3181":"For the price, you can't beat it!","3182":"Once I was cold and tall and now I'm still tall, but warm.

I love it!","3193":"Exactly as described. Bought it for my son for college. He likes it and the material is very soft! I like the price!","3194":"Soft, fluffy and great color.","3195":"Soft, fluffy and great color.","3196":"Okay, but overpriced for what it is. Nothing grand, but still a good price, so I bought it. Does the job, but feels more like a $20 set. It is soft though.","3197":"Got this for my little boy, it hasn't really been cold enough to use it but he pulled it out of the box and made a bed on the living room floor.","3198":"Decent comforter...i wouldn't agree with premium...its just ok. Suspect it'll be flat and unusable in less than a year. It's ok. Nothing special","3199":"I don't normally rate a product but my son is loving this pillow.  I ordered it for him as he is leaving for college soon and he has snuck it out of the college pile and into his room until he leaves.  Super soft feel and holds it shape.  I had my doubts  it would hold a shape of any sort as it was vacuumed sealed when it arrived, no worries a bit out of the bag with a slight fluff and it is good to go!  Great to prop yourself up to read or watch TV.","3200":"Fit was perfect and low price!","3201":"The color is so dull that it does not fit in with my purple color scheme.  It's not vibrant.VERY disappointed.","3202":"The blanket is not a lightweight blanket  or breathes. wanted this to be lighter for hot summers in the south states! This one is more for winter... that\u2019s why this blanket does not have a high score.","3203":"Love it!","3204":"Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  Although I haven't used it yet I have washed it and it is fluffy and has loops to attach to a duvet. I am very pleased with this product.","3205":"Really nice and fluffy.","3206":"very chemically, wouldn't want this on my bed - I bought it for the couch in my game room.","3207":"Decent bedding for the price.","3208":"Ordered this Nov 28 and I keep getting excuse. Do not order from Bare Home.","3209":"Sort of disappointed because they don't fit snugly.","3210":"This is not down alternative material. When you think  down alternative you would imagine the material having some weight to it. No not this one. Pretty dosappointing as I wanted a real down alternative comforter for my child's bed that would last a long time. To be honest we bought a comforter recently from Walmart (just a regular comforter not down alternative) and it feels the exact same. I would not purchase again.","3211":"Exactly as described, simple, comfortable. My son is doing a \"lego\" themed room so its hard to find something \"non-cheesy\" for that, so we opted for this comforter, blue sheets, blue walls, and primary colors for decor along with a lego lamp, posters, and an \"everything is awesome\" wall decal, worked perfect!","3212":"Great Love it","3213":"This was a gift for my 10 year old granddaughter.  She loves it so much because it's soft and her favorite color.  Had some trouble with the delivery because they thought it was a business but in fact it was a mobile home.","3214":"NICE","3215":"Received it today.  Very nice!!!","3216":"Vibrant color (as pictured). Easy to wash\/clean. After a couple weeks of use stitching is already coming undone.","3217":"Not as warm as I was hoping for.  I have purchased other down alternative that we just as warm as down but not this one.  My granddaughter loves the color so we will keep.","3218":"Ok product, looks as advertised, color is accurate. You get what you pay for, it is thin and flimsy. Efficient delivery, on time for Christmas. My granddaughter likes it.","3219":"This comforter was just the ticket. It was a purchase for my son's dorm room and it fit the Twin XL bed perfectly. It feels very soft and plush, not cheap and rough the way so many comforters are at this price point .  The blue is a really nice navy color as well - not so dark it almost looks black.My son says it is very nice and warm as well. Considering he's in Chicago, I'd say that's a winner!","3220":"Well made, soft and warm.  I bought it for my son, he is in love with it. Wish it came with sheets and pillow case though.","3221":"My daughter loved it.. good material..","3222":"I have purchased alternative down before and this is nothing like those. This just feels like a cheap thin comforter. I do t expect it to last long.","3223":"I did not like the fact that it did not come with a fitted sheet. That's false marketing. Just market it as a comforter not a comforter set.","3224":"perfect , little smell and disappeared after wash","3225":"Every night while I'm laying in my Ivy Union Premium Down Alternative Comforter, the soft plush sheets help me forget about my childhood. My mom never said she was proud of me. Can you believe that? What kind of mother spends all her time out of the house and some rat bar. These questions use to keep me up at night, but with this comforter, all my problems drift away.","3226":"My son loved it!!","3227":"Gift for college student.","3228":"I washed this item one time in my front loader washer and it started to un thread.","3229":"My sons says it hard to get out of bed since he got his comforter because he's so comfy.","3230":"The pluses:  the color is exactly as shown - very nice shade of blue; it is very soft and came thru the first laundering in nice condition.  The minus - it only measured 87\" long (before being washed) despite the ad saying 92\" (ad said Twin -XL).  This is a problem using it for college dorm beds - it will not hang as pictured (will not cover mattress at the ends or sides.  It would be a 5 star item as a Twin but it does not measure up to the Twin XL billing.","3231":"Not very good quality at all.  Wish I would have just spent the extra money and bought a better quality comforter.  I guess you really do get what you pay for.","3232":"Still in the box until next winter.","3233":"For the price, I mean you really can\u2019t beat it! I was looking for a new down comforter for myself and boyfriend and had found this comforter. I would describe this as a bang for your buck for sure! It is very nice for the price that you pay considering many that are comparable to this are about 60 to 80 dollars more. What I disliked about this comforter and why I gave it 4 stars was because of the texture of the comforter, it did not feel soft, something that you\u2019d get at a halfway decent motel even after washed. I also disliked the weight of it because it just felt like something I could buy at a local store. All in all I would say for the price you get what you pay for, would be nice for a spare room\/ guest room however it will not be staying on our everyday bed!","3234":"This comforter is awesome! It's heavy, but not overly warm. We live in Hawaii and my husband and I both sleep hot. Overheating hasn't been an issue for us at all. The size also allows both of us to cocoon without us having blanket hog issues. It arrived a few days sooner than we thought, and fluffed up nicely. Even if threads start coming loose later, as other reviews have said, we'll probably reorder it because you can't really beat the price vs quality.","3235":"Comfortable and lightweight, but quality not the best. The stuffing is coming out through the fabric after a few months of use and now looks horrible.","3236":"I bought a Twin XL for my 12 year old son's bed.  I washed it in my front loading machine with no issue.  It is very roomy and stays put.  It doesn't slide half off the bed like most comforters can do.  It is very soft and comfortable.  It has just the right amount of fill for him.  He tends to run a little warmer sleeping, even in the winter.","3237":"My mother got this for me Christmas 2020 and I absolutely love it. Very lightweight, fluffy, and has average softness. The comforter stays cool while keeping you warm. The pillow case I great too. Pretty average, but great. Would and have recommended.","3238":"Bought this for a dorm room.  Color is very nice, soft and comfortable with soft finish.  Great price and washable.","3239":"I really like this comforter. One problem I have with it is that I get WAY to warm when I sleep under it. I will typically kick off the comforter throughout the night because I get so hot. So Northerners this is great for you! I go to college in Florida and it is too hot. This would be perfect on my bed at home in South Dakota. It does have a slight \"cheap\" look to it, but in a dorm room it will fit in perfectly.","3240":"Nice quality, comfortable and snuggly but not overly hot which is awesome","3241":"This comforter is exactly what I hoped it was when I ordered it. I got the Navy color. The shade is very vibrant. Comforter is nice and comfy, has some good weight to it so you feel cozy under it.","3242":"Washed it according to the directions and the insides seemed to have melted in some of the squares and became crunchy.  Call the customer service number eve was told they wouldn't do anything. AWFUL company take your money somewhere else.  It also runs hot.","3243":"Less today...show comforter...not people on pictures.....","3244":"This comforter is great! It's exactly what I was looking for. It's not to heavy or light.  Very pleased with the quality, softness, and color of the item. I washed and dried it immediately after receiving and it came out looking great!","3245":"I absolutely love this comforter set. So soft. perfect weight, not heavy but stays in place well. So comfortable to sleep. Thanks for making it and such great quality.","3246":"I'm hot-blooded and a natural oven, but for some reason always need to be covered when I sleep. This blanket is perfect for all seasons and I plan on being a forever customer.","3247":"Very Nice. Well made and richly colored. I love this comforter. It came with 2 pillow shams. Great price and got here earlier than expected. Very happy with my purchase.","3248":"I really love this comforter! I have the taupe\/brown combo & it looks even better in person. Its super soft & looks just like the photos. It is a light warmth blanket. Perfect for us.","3249":"Comfortable and lightweight but just what J wanted. The two pillow cases are a nice bonus","3250":"Easy care, comes with pillow shams. Simply Beautiful.","3251":"I bought this set for my 10 YO son. He loves it. Once it fully fluffed from being packaged it looks so rich and full. He has had it set up for about a week now and has slept like a baby since.. Thanks","3252":"Lightweight, soft, warm, cozy.","3253":"Bought for son. Light weight but warm for chilly nights. Super soft and fluffs up nicely","3254":"Nice product came very fast only problem it is says a set . With that i bought it thinkin it came with a sheet for the bed....it doesnt at all but it does come with one pillow case","3255":"Incredibly soft and comfy. Makes me want to stay in bed all day.","3256":"I absolutely love it!!  It is soft, warm and looks good.","3257":"Poor quality. Very thin material with many loose threads all over it. In addition it had a number of threads of different colors laying on it and dust balls attached as well. Ewww...I was charged $18.00 to return. Bare Home is now on my Do Not Buy From list.","3258":"Light a perfect for summer","3259":"Great quality for the price.  Better then my Macy's  set.","3260":"comfy and looks fine.  Stitching seems solid.  It\u2019s plain...but that\u2019s the intent of the product.  Ridiculously good price point.","3261":"So very comfortable.","3262":"Color as shown, comfortable weight, not bulky, attractive.  Pleased with purchase","3263":"Ordered a King\/Cal King....states King, but barely a queen size. Couldn't return because it was opened.","3264":"my daughter loves it!","3265":"very warm but yet lightweight.. love it","3266":"I love it. Low price for good quality! I would recommend.","3267":"I used this for my son\u2019s room great quality for the price it\u2019s a steal.","3268":"Got this comforter for my bed in my college dorm room and I absolutely love it!  It is very comfortable and is keeping me warm as the weather is getting colder.  Also, it gives just the right pop of color to a drab dorm room.","3269":"This comforter is really soft, lightweight and comfortable!","3270":"Loved the blanket for my kids","3271":"The cost of the comforter for grandson for Christmas.","3272":"Super soft and comfy.","3273":"Before I purchased this I read other reviews. They were all positive. This comforter is true to size...Twin XL. I enjoy the softness. It's warm. It's cozy!","3274":"You get what you pay for. Cheap price right? There's your answer cheap quality! Just saying.....","3275":"I was not sure what to expect when I bought this set since it was such a great deal... Now I\u2019m kicking myself for not getting more! Absolutely a great product!!","3276":"Not happy at all. I thought I ordered the whole set with sheets and pillow cases","3277":"I loved the quality and color! I purchased this for my daughters room but contemplating on getting one for our bed! Worth the purchase!","3278":"Sheets feel and fit great.","3279":"Love this comforter! It's just like one at a nice hotel. It feels light weight but is very warm.","3280":"This was very nice","3281":"Very soft. Made just as nice as the expensive ones from department stores.","3282":"Grand girls loved them","3283":"I loved this so much (even if I hated how hard it was to clean) that I bought another ha ha","3284":"Unbelievable quality for the price.  I can't imagine college without comfortable bedding.","3285":"Designed to give you comfort and style! I am very pleased with this product and would recommend this to others who are looking for a simple, elegant comforter.","3286":"Ogxgicohhc","3287":"Love it!","3288":"Good quality and the color was true to the picture.","3289":"Lightweight yet warm","3290":"Love it, great quality for the price! Perfect color match :)","3291":"Love it! So far my dorm room looks great with it. It keeps me warm at night, i havent washed it yet so i can't tell you how it is in the washer\/dryer. But its pretty soft and i suggest you buy it! Lol","3292":"I could snuggle with this comforter all day long!  The quality, color, softness, and size is absolutely perfect!  I have already recommended this product to all my friends!  :)  Great job, TwinXL.com!  Will definitely continue ordering my bedding through you!","3293":"Great comforter!","3294":"it was great, fits good,","3295":"I had a Full\/Queen navy blue comforter purchased at a large housewares chain store for $90. Although it was great, it was way too heavy for summer; it did not lay smoothly on my bed, and I could not wash it in my HE front loader because it was too bulky. I have cats, so weekly washing is a must! I also live in the sticks, nearest laundromat is 30 miles away. This will not do!I waffled between this comforter and a sherpa comforter. Finally selected this style. When it arrived (it's in a vacuum sealed bag), I  stuffed it in my washing machine. It sermed to fit. However, when I washed it, it was still a wee bit too big for HE front loader, but not as bad as the $90 one from the houseware chain.  To dry it, just set on timed dry (I use 40 minutes), don't use \"sensor dry.\"The comforter is medium weight as described. It layed smoothly on my bed, much better than the $90 one from the houseware chain. It will work in summer with no extra blankets. Some people may think it's too heavy. Not sure about winter, will update when I find out.This color is a royal blue, not navy blue.  My color scheme was blue\/dark brown\/green. The royal blue looks richer in this scheme than navy blue.Cats jumped on bed and gave  \"paw up\" to how it felt. Yes, weekly washing is a MUST!","3296":"I\u2019m so so happy with this purchase!! I\u2019m the type of person to rarely if ever change their comforter, but I decided it was finally time for a switch! I\u2019m always skeptical finding bedding items online since you can\u2019t physically \u201ctry it out\u201d first, but this exceeded my expectations...It really makes a difference in my bedroom and I love the solid color. Looks just like the pictures! Super soft and warm but also lightweight. Would definitely recommend this comforter!!","3297":"OKAY so I got this blanket in oversized king. LET ME TELL YOU. This blanket is big enough for my fiance and I (two horrible blanket hoggers) and our baby in between. And theres still blanket left. This blanket is AMAZING. Just warm enough. Nice and soft. We got two thinking wed share but theyre too big. Having both in bed Is too much. I love this blanket. thank you for getting me to sleep in the same blanket as him again. I really missed it","3298":"I am skeptical purchasing comforters online. This comforter is great! It\u2019s super cozy and warm. This is coming from a New Yorker. So pleased I purchased this and it arrived before the anticipated date which made me warm inside and now out lol.Oh yes I get cold quickly and I have injuries that are worse in the cold. This is my new found love. I will purchase another to change up when it\u2019s time to wash.","3299":"Red is my favorite color and I love quilted style comforters. This one is soft, a beautiful shade of red, and definitely worth the price. It is soft and fluffy looking At this point I\u2019ve had it on my bed for several months, washed it 3 times, and have noticed no color fading, strings popping, or any negative aspects. It\u2019s cool enough summer temperatures (at least to me) and I have a Big Blanket Co. underneath it for winter, and also because I love having a \u201csheet\u201d without using a sheet. All in all, I\u2019m glad I got this. I did wash it upon arrival, but I don\u2019t remember if it had a smell. I just wanted to get the creases out of it and fluff it up from the packaging process.","3300":"Use this comforter in RV at my hunting camp.  This comforter is very soft, comfortable, and warm when it need be.  Probably a little dressy for RV but I spend a lot of time from October thru middle of February at my camp.  Nothing wrong with having a nice looking comforter that is warm and comfortable in the woods","3301":"This comforter is lightweight yet plenty warm, the fabric is so soft and comfortable too. I love it!  I'm going back to check other colors too since it's also hypoallergenic.  I've tried several comforters to get that fancy hotel quality of lightweight yet warm - THIS ONE I'M KEEPING!","3302":"I got the grey and it is a very nice dark gray color. In retrospect though i wish i would have chosen a different color because we have a yellow lab and she sheds EVERYWHERE. The comforter is lightweight but a little less warm than the down comforter we were using before. It will be great for the summer but right now in the winter we still need a blanket or two to throw on top. My only other concern is that i washed the comforter and pillow cases and some of the threading on the pillow cases started to come undone. Not a crazy amount like some reviews mention but still noticeable. Other than those two things this is a good cheap comforter (especially compared to all the others i could find that were over $100)","3303":"The moment I opened the package I noticed the \u201cblack\u201d comforter was actually greenish colored like a faded black \/ green. Definitely noticeable with all the other black in my room. It\u2019s a China product though so go figure","3304":"Love this comforter! I only like dark comforters bc I spill easily on them lol. Helps hide stains. Doesn\u2019t make u sweat and looks great! Worth the price! I got the navy blue. Recommend to anyone. Actually hangs low on my queen which I like. Very happy with my purchase \ud83d\ude01","3305":"Really live this blanket. I bought it for post surgery comfort next week and honestly I\u2019m not disappointed at all. I\u2019m unsure where the bad reviews come from as well. I ordered black and it\u2019s true to the color. The weight is heavy BUT light weight on your body at the same time. It\u2019s just perfect and I will be buying a diff color next month from here.","3306":"A good buy. I had low expectations. It came super thin and vacuum sealed, but after opening it, it got thicker and fluffier. It is a good secondary layer but I use it as a comforter in a guest room as it is black and pops. Good purchase for the price.","3307":"It\u2019s not really black it\u2019s more gunmetal. But I think you\u2019ll be happy with it it\u2019s thick and fluffy very comfortable very warm I haven\u2019t use the pillow shams but the pillowcases fit great I really like it I would buy it again I like the color that it is but if you\u2019re looking for dark black it\u2019s not dark it\u2019s kind of ashy.","3308":"I love this comforter. Washed it and it came out fine and it is so good temperature wise at nice and is so fluffy and cuddly. If you like to be colder when you sleep this isn\u2019t the comforter for you but if you like keeping your body heat this is a great price and great product!","3309":"Finally the right size! Oversized king hangs off the sides nicely and white goes with everything.","3310":"For the blanket to be lightweight, it holds in heat so well. My room is in the basement and it\u2019s usually cold down here for some reason, however this blanket keeps me warm all through the night. It\u2019s lightweight out the package but kinda feels like a weighted blanket when sleeping, or maybe I\u2019m just too tired to tell the difference. This is definitely a good buy. It comes with the comforter and 2 pillow cases.","3311":"Well worth the value. It washed and dried nicely, it is warm with making me sweat, soft, and fluffy. I would definitely buy this product again. The dog loves making a snuggle nest with this comforter too.","3312":"Arrived as scheduled, without demage, doing these time, this is a great way to order your favor products, without leaving the safety of your home","3313":"For the price this is amazing. Works perfect in the room I needed it for. It\u2019s very soft and light weight. I hope it eases up well, as the cats love it and leave their hair on it!!","3314":"Very warm, well made, and comfy. Fits our king sized bed perfectly. The comforter is thick and is warm so be aware of that.","3315":"Love this quilt! I was a bit hesitant after reading some of the comments, but I\u2019m extremely pleased. The color is true to the photo- a very rich color. The weight is perfect! I am very pleased.","3316":"Have wanted an all black theme on my bed ever since I was a teenager, and this was the perfect thing to finish that off. It\u2019s extremely comfortable, it keeps me really warm when it\u2019s cold outside but it\u2019s also not so thick that I\u2019m sweating all the time. Highly recommend it, extremely comfortable. Very happy with it.","3317":"Light weight and very warm.. pleasantly surprised,not to thick..feels like a quilt without the size,\ud83d\ude0cawesome.","3318":"I used this on my twin XL dorm bed, so its like two comforters ( i have it folded in half) which is nice because I get cold easily! I haven't washed it yet but its really soft and warm when it needs to be and not too hot when I dont want it to be. this sandy color is really light, almost beige-ish or off white in some lighting! so just beware of that but overall a super good comforter","3319":"Best comforter set I've ever bought. Can wash in the washer machine without worrying about feathers falling out and getting bunch up. Very soft and not to hot.  I use it year around.","3320":"Beautiful! Very soft and fluffy!! My son loves the red for his room. He said it is so comfortable!","3321":"Thus is so warm and cozy for sleeping. Light weight so it doesn't weigh you down. Like the length but wish it was wider. Doesn't cover any of the exposed space under the bed.","3322":"Quality seems very nice. Exactly what I was expecting.  Really like the shade of taupe.","3323":"Machine washable. I washed it for about 3 times and there\u2019s no tears or damage. Pretty light weighted and warm. Recommend.","3324":"I love this set!  It\u2019s beautiful as well as serviceable.  It looks great in the bedroom I will have my granddaughter stay in when she comes.","3325":"We wanted a solid red comforter. This was the perfect solution. After having it for a few months and washing it several times, we are more than satisfied!","3326":"These are soft they're even good for the winter not too thick not too thin just perfect The color is good they're warm and they wash well","3327":"It is so nice to go to sleep on this soft and comfortable","3328":"The color is beautiful, soft, cozy and easy cleaning instructions.","3329":"THIS COMFORTER SET IS WONDERFUL. FEELS NICE AND LOOKS GREAT ON MY BED. MADE WELL. QUICK TO SHIP","3330":"The comforter is a great color, very warm, and extremely comfortable. My only complaint is there are a lot of loose threads. I have gotten my arm and hand caught in them multiple times and I often have to cut them off.","3331":"El color es segun lo indica en la foto y me gusto la tela","3332":"Very soft and warm. It\u2019s  easy to wash.","3333":"Nice comforter my grandson loves it","3334":"love this it is so fluffy and comfy!","3335":"This comforter was very nice!!!","3336":"For the money this was a great buy","3337":"Heavy but like putting a scoop of cold ice cream on a warmed up desert. Perfection! I love my blanket!!! You will too.","3338":"Superb beautiful item","3339":"It\u2019s a great comforter for the price.","3340":"This comfortable is great if you sleep in Alaska. We keep our house at a brisk 66\u00b0 in the winter and my 4 year old son was sweating underneath this. But it is really soft and a great deal for the $","3341":"Got this blanket for my daughter and it\u2019s perfect! It\u2019s not heavy or too large, it\u2019s extremely soft and comfortable and most definitely warm!","3342":"Bought this in Red! true to color! Soft? Oh Yes! Well made! Border is double stitched!  Very nice!","3343":"Very comfortable.","3344":"My do loves this! So soft and comfy","3345":"Super comfy and soft. It does come very wrinkled out of the package and I saw a few people saying they ironed it at low heat but I'm so scared to mess it up. As it is the color (sand) looks beautiful but I'm scared of anything staining it.","3346":"Beautiful and comfort","3347":"Warm cozy","3348":"Really nice and made comfort!","3349":"Looks great in my daughters room washes well and did not lose its color","3350":"Great","3351":"So soft, we are ordering them for other beds as well.

It fit in our duvet cover perfectly! Our daughter will love it!","3444":"Great","3445":"I love it!","3446":"Na","3447":"Perfect","3448":"It came with a tear.","3449":"Love it! Nice quality and soft and very comfortable","3450":"love it! very comfy","3451":"Very soft and comfortable: Update poorly stitched pillowcases fell apart in the washer","3452":"I bought this mainly based on price ($40.00) and I am very pleased with the quality. The fabric is very soft, and it keeps me nice and toasty warm at night without needing to add blankets. Definitely a great choice!","3453":"Hotel quality comforter,Very good product. Works well.","3454":"Perfect","3455":"Great very soft and warm but the black has a greenish tint to it","3456":"Soft and comfy my toddler slept through his first night in his big kid bed with this comforter!","3457":"Very poofy, comfortable blanket. Don't get black if you have cats.","3458":"I am impressed with this comforter. Its exactly what I wanted to replace my old one. Soft, fluffy, and the perfect color. I read the negative reviews and was hesitant, but I am so glad I stuck with the positive ones. This is a great comforter at a great affordable price. I highly recommend!","3459":"Very nice comforter. It\u2019s soft and thick just like I\u2019d hope it would be.","3460":"I bought the 'sand' comforter. The color in the listing (both photo and color square) is a light tan - exactly what I wanted. The 'sand' comforter I received is a very bright pinkish ivory. Not at all like the ad.","3461":"Really nice. Not super thick but I didnt want that. Covers entire bed and hangs off sides. I love it.","3462":"I bought the black one! Great little throw for the bed! although It did leave little pieces of black lint on my comforter but after washing it in the great mesh bag it came with, problem resolved! It washes great!","3463":"cannot believe the quality and softness for the cost","3464":"Got it for college but im at home now and still using it! Very comfortable and soft. Very light weight and not heavy at all!","3465":"Mine had a seam that wasn't stitched through all layers of the fabric. I NEEDED it immediately, so I was stuck with it. I'm let down by this company, maybe they'll fix the issue now. I'll update if they do. I can't recommend due to customer service.","3466":"Surprised at the quality of the comforter for the price. Well made and heavier than expected. Pillow shams on the thin side, but still decent. Will be buying another in a different color.","3467":"I ordered this blanket for my 5yr olds xl twin bed and my 13yr olds full size bed....both blanket(which are different colors) were vibrant and well made. they were soft, well stitched, and came with a matching sham. both children love to be warm but love the cool feeling of sheets and this blanket gives them that satisfaction! I would purchase OVER and OVER again!!! the quality alone is worth it and the price makes it even better!","3468":"My partner is 6'4\u201c, 260 lbs. When he rolls over with the blankets, there\u2019s nothing l\u2019est for me. Then comes this oversized comforter. Game changer. Always some left for me.  At least a foot of overhang on the sides, which looks much nicer than standard king size comforter that look as they are floating atop the bed and not hiddind the sheets.","3469":"After a good washer & dryer pass! , the comforter becomes floppy and it does not change color, a little bit too warm for the summer, it will be perfect for winter, it didn't smell awful when out of the plastic bag, very good quality for less than $100 Canadian and I recommended this comforter, receive it less than a week after ordering. WOW!","3470":"10 years never been able to share a blanket with the wife. Not only can we now but also have 3 dogs and still enough blanket to spare. So nice I bought 2 more for gifts","3471":"After seeking out a lightweight comforter in this color, I was pleasantly surprised by this Bare Home comforter.  Very well mage. soft but strong material.  My cats nails don't harm it at all, HOWEVER, it is a bugger to catching, holding on to and showing cat hair, whereas my previous bright pink percale comforter didn't show it.  I do really love the comforter though!  I haven't washed it yet.  Hopefully the hair won't grab on so much!  Fingers crossed.  I also sleep rather hot, so hopefully after washing, it won't be quite so warm!  For those of you always cool. you shouldn't have any problem!","3472":"10\/10 would recommend.This set is so warm and light weight. We are super warm under this comforter. It's light weight and we don't feel smothered under it. It's so soft and we've been sleeping so well. This oversized comforter covers the mattress from side to side as advertised, our mattress is 16 inches thick. I did measure to make sure it would fit and It's exactly what I was looking for.","3473":"I've been using this blanket for a few weeks and I'm obsessed. I have a 10\" foam mattress and this blanket hangs off the sides perfectly!! It's very comfortable and will be perfect for spring and summer. It's a bit cold where I am, so I have a fuzzy blanket I use as well as this blanket alone isn't warm enough.","3474":"warm, but lightweight. well made. good value for the money. but colors are drab\/flat. both the beige and gray kingsize ones i bought were very muted, almost like moving blankets ir sleeping bags. i jazzed them up with bright throws and pillows tho, which helps. product would get 5 stars from me if only the colors were richer in tone.","3475":"I love this comforter.  It's extra wide and long, so it hangs down on both sides of the bed.  Colour is so vivid. Love the red.  I draped a Christmas comforter that I had for a queen size bed across the bottom & added the Christmas shams.  I take my comforter off at night so that it stays perfect for many years.  I did take a warm iron and ironed it while on the bed, just to take out the wrinkles.  It turned out so well.  I'm definitely going to order another one in another colour.  Couldn't be happier.","3476":"Recently bought an adjustable bed and it seemed the Costco  regular duvet king size makes one or both of us uncovered when at different heights.This oversized king was the perfect size.It is extra soft and amazingly warm for the lightweight of it.  We loved it from the first day it arrived and immediately ordered the king \/ Cali King that same day for our RV.","3477":"Bought as a gift for my sister & she loves it. Beautiful color, fits great on the bed & definitely keeps you warm. Would recommend washing on a gentle cycle if possible to avoid having the stitching tear.","3478":"Not very thick, but SO warm!!! I\u2019m very very happy with my purchase. Quality is wonderful.  It\u2019s soft and super warm! My hubby loves how light weight it is. Great buy! Thanks seller :)","3479":"Received it yesterday and was excited to use it because the material seems nice but I noticed there are stitches that are coming undone on the first day.... I had high hopes but I am thoroughly disappointed.","3480":"Je voulais changer le couvre-lit de ma chambre  et les oreillers mais, ce que vous m'avez livr\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9chir\u00e9.Je les ai lav\u00e9s et c'est l\u00e0 que j'ai vu les bris. Que dois-je faire???","3481":"Belle qualit\u00e9, chaude et tr\u00e8s grande 120 pouces par 96 pouces . Nous avons un lit queen mais avec une base haute et un matelas \u00e9pais donc un \u00e9dredon queen est trop petite. L\u2019\u00e9dredon King est parfaite pour notre lit.","3482":"I absolutely love this comforter. Definitely value for the price. It hangs perfectly over the side of a king bed like the picture shows and has a beautiful brushed soft texture like in the photo too. Was going to put a duvet cover on it but not needed. Perfect warmth and thickness.","3483":"I have been looking for a longer comforter because my king cover only went to the ends of the top of the mattress.  This comforter is soft, fluffy and goes over the mattress alot on both sides ! So happy with my purchase!!!","3484":"Just like other reviews did have a lot of loose threading, but I washed it and it hasn\u2019t fallen apart, it quite heavy if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, still happy to be warm during cold weather.","3485":"Highly suggest staying away from the black. It looks nothing like the picture. It a weird gray\/greenish colour and I will definitely be returning it. Other then the colour it feels good and has a decent weight to it.","3486":"It is plain looking but attractive. The colour is vibrant and same as the picture. It covers the whole bed which is nice as there is no skirt. It is a light weight and for winter would require an additional blanket.","3487":"the comforter itself is light and breathable and not suffocating. however, it gathers lint quickly and isnt built to last like the ad claims. i would invest in another set. i'm not sure if its because i got a faulty set or if the company doesnt stand for what they claim to provide.","3488":"We gave her this new bedspread for a passing present for her new bedroom. she loves it.","3489":"A very large size \"Full\" too big for my bed really. Very warm in the summer. Too warm.","3490":"It was a great product but after I washed it I'm not sure what happened some parts looked stained for some reason but I really wish that wasn't the case as  I really liked the quality. Excellent customer service.","3491":"Best comforter ever. Perfect warmth and lightweight but not too thin. Size is excellent. Only comforter I found to fully cover king bed and sides of bed fully covered. Waiting for two more colours to become available in this size.","3492":"Totaly covers a king size bed with a thick mattress.  Nice weight for a good nights sleep.  Looks very nice.  Very good quality.  I would recommend this product","3493":"Absolutely love it. No more fighting with a duvet cover! I would definitely buy this again. I like that it is wide enough to hang over both sides too. I got the oversized king and I am really happy with it.","3494":"Le produit n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la couleur que nous d\u00e9sirions! Nous l\u2019avions pris noir, mais il avait des reflets verd\u00e2tres. Toutefois, le produit \u00e9tait de bonne qualit\u00e9 et nous avons eu un EXCELLENT service apr\u00e8s vente! Merci beaucoup :)","3495":"What's a little bigger than I want it to be.  Quality seems good","3496":"So comfy!!!!! We have a king size bed and we no longer have to fight for the blankets!!! \ud83e\udd23","3497":"Not happy at all","3498":"Tr\u00e8s bien et l\u00e9ger. Utilisez pour salle de s\u00e9jour.","3499":"Nice and simple comforter. Good stitching and lightweight!","3500":"There were white marks on the comforter almost appearing to be body fluid....absolutely unsanitary!!!I noticed another review with the same issue for the red comforter but I still took a chance.","3501":"Wow wonderful and so warm very good quality","3502":"It is easy to wash, is very comfy and nice","3503":"Top reviews for this comforter. Finally a king size comforter that drapes nicely down the sides of the bed. Good quality and price.  Glad i made this purchase.","3504":"Cheap and very bad quality. Was stained.","3505":"I love this comforter!! It is extremely warm!! I purchased some floral shams also to jazz it up a bit. There was too much grey otherwise. I like contrast.","3506":"Very comfortable and looks good","3507":"Very good quality","3508":"Love this! I don\u2019t normally write reviews but I had to for this, it\u2019s soft, lightweight but also keeps you warm at the same time, it\u2019s so comfortable, super happy with my purchase!","3509":"Soft and perfect size.  Love the colour.  It is very nice!! My teen daughter likes it a lot.","3510":"A bit wrinkled so hoping it disappears over time","3511":"Love the weight of this blanket. It\u2019s a perfect size. Will keep you warm at night","3512":"Microfiber my ass.. its 100% Polyester... both inside and cover... I am allergic to polyester... Microfiber comes from cotton not polyester.. I want my money back!!","3513":"Very soft, warm and comfortable. More of a comforter than a duvet. Would recommend.","3514":"Tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9!","3515":"It seems like I have received a used product. There were questionable stains on multiple places and a tear. will definitely be returning.","3516":"Tr\u00e8s beau produit la qualit\u00e9 et la","3517":"After the first wash, the color has faded; weird spots have appeared that look greasy","3518":"This comforter is thick and cozy.

It's light weight and warm","3527":"Love this comforter! No more fighting over blankets, love the size!
