0,2020-09-30,629,"I own the previous non-4k model, and this is a much better experience. First off, It's faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. The user interface is snappier and more responsive all around, unlike the older Fire Stick, which does occasionally lag. It's crisp and clear, and intuitive to operate - and set-up is a piece of cake.If you are wondering whether an elderly or technophobic person can handle the setup process, the answer is yes. The onscreen prompts guide you through everything, and should be easy for anyone to follow, even if don't consider yourself tech savvy. And in terms of the physical hardware, there are only like 2 steps: 1) Connect the Stick to a power source 2) Plug the Stick into any open HDMI port, which you'll find on the back or side of your TV.Also, If you're wondering if the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) suits you more. I would say it’s a question of personal preference. The Fire TV Stick Lite version does not support Dolby Atmos audio and the included Alexa Voice Remote Lite does not have power or volume buttons. Personally, the Lite version is fine for me as I have another remote which controls my TV’s volume and power button and I do not have a soundbar. However, I would recommend anyone with different devices connected to their TV such as soundbars to buy the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) version as this would allow you to control everything all at once, however it is slightly higher in price compared to this one.Finally If you're wondering whether the Lite version is a gimmick or whether it's worth it, the answer is: it's worth it, because it's as if they ironed out all the little kinks and pain points to get the user to their chosen content as quickly as possible. All the little improvements in terms of the speed/function, and the upgraded Alexa remote with the new “guide” button which takes you straight to your videos makes the Lite version a pleasure to use.Amazon needs to keep up the good work. This Lite stick is a solid product and an excellent upgrade (for those on a budget) from the previous model. Hope this helps!",New Fire TV Lite is a fantastic budget streaming device!

1,2020-10-03,186,"All functionality is quick and responsive as you would expect so can't be faulted in that respect.However, if, like me, you might side load some additional Apps onto your Firestick, which are not linked to your Amazon Account, you might see that the image / icon for the App does not appear in your Apps list and instead you get a ""greyed out"" box. The App will install and work fine once you open it, but the obvious visual for it is missing on your home screen and My Apps lists and if you have a few of them, you will have to guess which app you are opening. Example pictured.This Fire TV Lite OS is Version 7.2.2.3, presumably bang up to date, and this does not happen (in my experience) with previous OS on the 4k Stick for example which is version 6.2.7.3.I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and Factory resets but it is still the same. Might this be a ""glitch"" with the latest OS, Version 7, that needs fixing?","Like any other Firestick, but with one irritating feature....so far",3,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ls-54STzL._SY88.jpg,RW3QA8WMV68UM,UK,2020,autumn,Neutral,Europe,True
2,2020-10-15,156,"We already have the more expensive fire stick in our main tv which we love.Our second tv doesnt support Brit Box so we decided on another fire stick but opted for this version as its quite a bit cheaper.The only difference is three buttons on the remote.  The ability to turn the tv off and adjust the volume.  Weve never used these buttons anyway as we just use the ones on the tv remote so it was a no brainer to go for the cheaper option.Fire sticks are so easy to set up and use.Plug the little unit into one of your tvs usb ports, plug into the mains.  Switch tv on, select fire stick and follow the onscreen instructions.It supports all the catch up channels plus Netflix ,Brit Box, Disney, the list goes on.Really good interface and will either update your tv to a smart one or update your already smart tv should it not support certain apps.I would certainly recommend this version for price, ease of use and a great viewing experience.",Just as good as more expensive version,5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KG4lRwFCL._SY88.jpg ~ https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SLtcipiIL._SY88.jpg ~ https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ge05a93sL._SY88.jpg ~ https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MIROfFuRL._SY88.jpg,RGYB2ILPLMBQ7,UK,2020,autumn,Positive,Europe,True
3,2020-10-11,138,"I have every generation of stick except the 4k and they are all still going strong, even the G1. I use them for everything, prime video, Netflix, britbox and all the mainstream apps like iplayer but I also sideload non amazon apps like KODI.  I had absolutely no problem uploading the apps (see pic) and they all loaded with their icons. They work swiftly and I am hugely impressed with the speed of this stick.I loaded in this order. Sign in with Amazon, go to settings and enable apps from unknown sources and ADB debugging in the developer options. Then  loaded the mainstream apps from the amazon store and then side loaded my other apps. All done without problem in less than 30 mins.If, like the other reviewer you struggle with grey icons then Google it. It is not a new problem and there are countless sites with help on how to sort it out.As for the stick itself I really recommend it. I have no need for 4k (due to 720p eyes), i never use the TV buttons on my other controls and I have no need for dolby atmos.  My only gripe would be some price creep  I paid less for my last full featured stick than this lite version.

7,2018-12-29,197,"Here we go...I spent hours reading product reviews for comforters that were washable, warm and within my budget (under $50). I purchased 2 of these comforters and they arrived yesterday. First off, the Navy and Gray colors aren'tt as dark as the picture shows, no big deal to me as I wasn't concerned about the color as much as I was about it being washable and warm!We washed the Navy one first in a front loading washer - these are big comforters, not too puffy or thick but thick enough that it was a squeeze into the washer. That being said, just run an extra rinse cycle so all the detergent comes out and hang dry over a shower curtain rod or staircase bannister to let it completely dry.Now here's why this product only received 3 STARS: As soon as I took it out and inspected it, so many seams were loose and coming undone! No stuffing had come out, but after one wash seams are already coming loose. We wash our blankets often, and the whole point of finding a washable comforter was so that we didn't need to buy duvet covers. However, after already washing both blankets, it's safe to say that we will be using duvet covers to protect them for more long term use.Now for the positive: This blanket is so warm! Not too fluffy, which is what we wanted, but warm and cozy! I slept so well with it last night inside my new duvet, although I'm annoyed that the blanket seems to already show lesser quality than expected, inside a duvet it should last MUCH longer than if we used and washed it regularly.Overall, not a horrible purchase. In my opinion, will not sustain regular washes, but with a duvet it will last! That being said, buy the cheapest color I'd you are going to end up putting it into a duvet!","Not what I expected, but not the worst...",3,,R2YIDSQLIBMKG4,USA,2018,winter,Neutral,North-America,True

Therefore, for £30 decided to update my eight year old Sony Bravia KDL Model that no longer had the energy or capability to support iPlayer, You Tube etc. Installation, took less than 15 minutes, very easy. Then, the updates since manufacture loaded, and the bar made its progress across the screen and 'Wallah' my television was transformed! Picture quality and sound, brilliant.

14,2020-11-11,12,"I haven't given any stars for Alexa integration, for the simple reason that I haven't used it. Can't be bothered with all this newfangled voice control stuff. That's why I went with the Lite version in the first place - why pay for a bunch of bells and whistles I'm not going to use?As for the rest, though, I have no complaints. It was very simple and straightforward to set up and use. The stick is designed to plug into a spare HDMI port on the TV, but wouldn't fit due to a plug in the adjacent port. Fortunately they've allowed for this eventuality by including a short HDMI extension lead, and that did the trick.After that, all I had to do was follow the on-screen instructions to link it to my wi-fi and then my streaming accounts. That was slightly time-consuming due to having to enter all the various passwords and authorization codes, but once it's done it's done and I can watch to my heart's content.The picture quality's fine and I've had no problems. Watching Netflix and Amazon Prime shows via the Fire stick is an improvement from watching via Virgin, because there's no frame-rate incompatibility, so no motion judder.If a programme is left in pause for too long the screen will revert to a photo slideshow, but pressing the ""U-turn"" button will take you back to the Resume option.As for the remote, it's much smaller and lighter than those for my TV, Blu-ray, etc., but the controls are simple and intuitive. My only minor quibble is that using the up/down/left/right buttons to search through menus can make my finger a bit sore (and yes, that wouldn't happen with Alexa, but then my throat might get sore!)Given its small size and cheapness this gadget punches way above its weight and I have no hesitation in recommending it.

15,2015-06-14,180,"we picked up this two years ago, first the good. upon arrival the comforter was well made, no stray threads or any other quality issues. the coloring is good, uniform and stands up well to cleaning. it is medium weight but does an exceptional job holding in warmth. on a cold winter night it certainly does the job. as to fit it is just as expected no issues there at all.the not so good (mostly due to us). a couple times a year we'd throw it into the washer and had no problems (nearest dry cleaner is a 60 mile round trip). but with time things happen. the last time it was washed, a few months back we noticed some of the quilted threads had started to come loose and pop up. it was only a few no big deal but now unfortunately a lot more of those cross threads are coming loose. again it is just over two years old and it wasn't all that costly so I really can't complain.all said it still looks good but I don't expect to be able to wash this again without it coming apart even more so. we'll keep it til summer which will be the three year mark and then get a replacement. that replacement will be the same as we genuinely have been happy with this the entire time we've had it in use.caveat, dry cleaning would make it last much longer however when factoring the cost to have that done versus replacement after three years it really made no financial sense to go that route.","Updated 1/9/2019 after two plus years use and,..",5,,R3O5YVXR9WQTCX,USA,2015,spring,Positive,North-America,True

It is super soft when you run your hand over it and it is super plush - I have not been able to get my cats off of it since I put it on the bed two days ago. I have a full-sized mattress and it covers it evenly, without being too long on any side (I DO fold it down about a foot and a half, which keeps it from touching the floor at the end of the bed). One thing I have noticed is that it gets a bit warm, but it is perfect if you have a/c running. I imagine that this will be perfect in the winter, and I won't need to pile additional blankets on it to compensate.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase!UPDATE:I have had this for a week now, and one thing I noticed was a defect with a lot of extra string along one of the seams of a few the comforter squares. To keep my cats from getting caught in or chewing on the string, I had to cut it, which ended up opening that seam.  So the squares are now connected, but so far it hasn't made any difference, and I don't think it will in the long run. I contacted the company anyway and they replied quickly and told me to get in touch with them immediately if it causes any issues, so I am keeping my 5 star rating for their fast reply and promise of service.Otherwise, I'm still happy with it, and very glad I purchased it.","Very Soft, Very Plush, Very Comfortable!",5,,R1QPPEBHHUEKHF,USA,2018,summer,Positive,North-America,True

19,2019-04-28,20,I was searching for an inexpensive comforter set for our guest room. This set fits the bill!  It's very soft and light weight.  I got the taupe in twin size.  The color looks just like it does on my computer monitor.  The pillow sham that comes with the comforter has a flanged edge.  I tried using it on my bed the same way it's shown in the picture.  The flanged edge wouldn't stand up though because the fabric isn't stiff enough.  I ended up turning the sham inside out (so the flange doesn't show) before I put my pillow in it.  The fabric is exactly the same on both sides so I was able to do this.  I think it looks better that way.  The comforter comes in a vacuum sealed package and looks very flat when you first open it up.  I put it in the dryer (on low heat) for 20 minutes before putting it on my bed. It fluffed up nicely! It did look a little wrinkled (even after coming out of the dryer) so I ironed it on low heat without even taking it off the bed.  I haven't washed it yet.  When I do I will take it to the laundromat and wash it in a large capacity washer.

It's a little bit more expensive but that's just the way marketing works to drive you onto the new device and it still works just aswell in terms of voice activation.I love the device, I love the ease of use, how well it works and the thousands of different skills you can enable to maximise your use of your smart home device. The Show 5 has a nice compact size, has a screen if you want to view video recipes, can set timers, can give you definitions or synonyms, can answer most questions, can play movies, can show you who is at your door, can show you your CCTV and can order your shopping if you want.The possibilities are endless and the device is really impressive. The volume capabilities are decent for the size of it and overall I'm very happy with the value for money. Sure there's not huge improvements on the 1st Gen device, but then the 1st Gen is a perfectly good smart home system that in my opinion didn't really need improved.Conclusion the same great device with some minor tweaks.

40,2019-08-09,17,"I feel like, even though it is stated far enough down in the description that this only contains a blanket and one pillowcase, that this is false advertising. It is advertised as a ""set"" and most people in the market for a bed set assume that means a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and a pillowcase, at the minimum. While this is predominantly advertising a comforter/blanket, it still uses the word ""set"" and features a fully made up bed. After shopping for hours for what I wanted, the reason I bought this was because I thought I was getting a complete set of blanket and sheets. Technically, that's my fault and my brain and eyes' fault for being so focused on a ""set"" but still.....I feel like surely others were conned into thinking that, too? Anyways.....aside from THAT huge disappointment.....I bought Cypress green and it is an army green which I like, but not as rich/bright as the product page photo. It is more muted/drab. The fabric is soft enough, the pillowcase is pretty thin, and the overall stitching on both the pillowcase and comforter looks like it won't last long before unraveling. There were stray threads everywhere, some were of the same color, some appeared to come from other products (red, blue, etc). The blanket is lightweight with minimal stuffing when you live in the mountains and are used to high loft down comforters of equal weight. I don't know....I just don't have a very positive first impression of this ""set"" for the price.

42,2020-09-19,5,"I loved the amount of positive reviews on this product which gave me confidence to purchase.  In particular, I was reading through them looking for how hot this comforter makes others feel as they sleep and found several mentions that people thought it was perfect.  Not too hot.  The comforter arrived almost a week earlier than estimated delivery, which was great!  I love the look of it and it has a really nice soft feel to it.  We went with the black in the oversized king size and it really looked nice on the bed (standard king), draping over the sides and end without touching the floor.  It quickly puffed up after unpacking and placing it on the bed (it comes vacuum sealed in a bag nice and small).Unfortunately for my wife and I, it just did not meet our expectations and was very hot to sleep under.  My wife, who is always cold, told me that she woke up sweating in the night and had moved it off of her.  I managed to sleep through the nights but woke up with the comforter pushed down below my knees.  The temps have been in the upper 60s in the house as fall is setting in, which typically would mean we both have the comforter on through the night. I will say it does have a decent weighted feeling to it as you are under it, and I’m sure some, if not a majority of others, will find this comforter perfect for their needs.  For us it was just too hot compared to our existing comforter.  For comparison/reference, this was meant to replace our current comforter which is one of the discontinued Sheex brand.For those curious about the customer service or reading other reviews about them, I contacted them about a return and even though it was a weekend I received a response back within a couple hours.  They’ve been simply amazing to deal with as a buyer, delivering much earlier than estimated, answering so promptly regarding a return, and refunding me in full while also providing an amazing solution to the issue of returning the product.  AMAZING customer service from this seller!

3302,2021-02-01,0,I got the grey and it is a very nice dark gray color. In retrospect though i wish i would have chosen a different color because we have a yellow lab and she sheds EVERYWHERE. The comforter is lightweight but a little less warm than the down comforter we were using before. It will be great for the summer but right now in the winter we still need a blanket or two to throw on top. My only other concern is that i washed the comforter and pillow cases and some of the threading on the pillow cases started to come undone. Not a crazy amount like some reviews mention but still noticeable. Other than those two things this is a good cheap comforter (especially compared to all the others i could find that were over $100),Lightweight but not super warm,5,,R3AMTBNDE1PJOG,USA,2021,winter,Positive,North-America,False
