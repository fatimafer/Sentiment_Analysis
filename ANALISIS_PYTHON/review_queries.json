In particular, I was reading through them looking for how hot this comforter makes others feel as they sleep and found several mentions that people thought it was perfect.  Not too hot.  The comforter arrived almost a week earlier than estimated delivery, which was great!  I love the look of it and it has a really nice soft feel to it.  We went with the black in the oversized king size and it really looked nice on the bed (standard king), draping over the sides and end without touching the floor.  It quickly puffed up after unpacking and placing it on the bed (it comes vacuum sealed in a bag nice and small).Unfortunately for my wife and I, it just did not meet our expectations and was very hot to sleep under.  My wife, who is always cold, told me that she woke up sweating in the night and had moved it off of her.  I managed to sleep through the nights but woke up with the comforter pushed down below my knees.  The temps have been in the upper 60s in the house as fall is setting in, which typically would mean we both have the comforter on through the night. I will say it does have a decent weighted feeling to it as you are under it, and I\u2019m sure some, if not a majority of others, will find this comforter perfect for their needs.  For us it was just too hot compared to our existing comforter.

In particular, I was reading through them looking for how hot this comforter makes others feel as they sleep and found several mentions that people thought it was perfect.  Not too hot.  The comforter arrived almost a week earlier than estimated delivery, which was great!  I love the look of it and it has a really nice soft feel to it.  We went with the black in the oversized king size and it really looked nice on the bed (standard king), draping over the sides and end without touching the floor.  It quickly puffed up after unpacking and placing it on the bed (it comes vacuum sealed in a bag nice and small).<br/><br/>Unfortunately for my wife and I, it just did not meet our expectations and was very hot to sleep under.  My wife, who is always cold, told me that she woke up sweating in the night and had moved it off of her.  I managed to sleep through the nights but woke up with the comforter pushed down below my knees.  The temps have been in the upper 60s in the house as fall is setting in, which typically would mean we both have the comforter on through the night.
