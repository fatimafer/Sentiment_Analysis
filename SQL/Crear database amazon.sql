INSERT INTO `amazon_review` VALUES (0,'2020-09-30 00:00:00',629,'I own the previous non-4k model, and this is a much better experience. First off, It\'s faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. The user interface is snappier and more responsive all around, unlike the older Fire Stick, which does occasionally lag. It\'s crisp and clear, and intuitive to operate - and set-up is a piece of cake.If you are wondering whether an elderly or technophobic person can handle the setup process, the answer is yes. The onscreen prompts guide you through everything, and should be easy for anyone to follow, even if don\'t consider yourself tech savvy. And in terms of the physical hardware, there are only like 2 steps: 1) Connect the Stick to a power source 2) Plug the Stick into any open HDMI port, which you\'ll find on the back or side of your TV.Also, If you\'re wondering if the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) suits you more. I would say it’s a question of personal preference. The Fire TV Stick Lite version does not support Dolby Atmos audio and the included Alexa Voice Remote Lite does not have power or volume buttons. Personally, the Lite version is fine for me as I have another remote which controls my TV’s volume and power button and I do not have a soundbar. However, I would recommend anyone with different devices connected to their TV such as soundbars to buy the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) version as this would allow you to control everything all at once, however it is slightly higher in price compared to this one.Finally If you\'re wondering whether the Lite version is a gimmick or whether it\'s worth it, the answer is: it\'s worth it, because it\'s as if they ironed out all the little kinks and pain points to get the user to their chosen content as quickly as possible. All the little improvements in terms of the speed/function, and the upgraded Alexa remote with the new “guide” button which takes you straight to your videos makes the Lite version a pleasure to use.Amazon needs to keep up the good work. This Lite stick is a solid product and an excellent upgrade (for those on a budget) from the previous model. Hope this helps!','New Fire TV Lite is a fantastic budget streaming device!

First off, the Navy and Gray colors aren\'tt as dark as the picture shows, no big deal to me as I wasn\'t concerned about the color as much as I was about it being washable and warm!We washed the Navy one first in a front loading washer - these are big comforters, not too puffy or thick but thick enough that it was a squeeze into the washer. That being said, just run an extra rinse cycle so all the detergent comes out and hang dry over a shower curtain rod or staircase bannister to let it completely dry.Now here\'s why this product only received 3 STARS: As soon as I took it out and inspected it, so many seams were loose and coming undone! No stuffing had come out, but after one wash seams are already coming loose. We wash our blankets often, and the whole point of finding a washable comforter was so that we didn\'t need to buy duvet covers. However, after already washing both blankets, it\'s safe to say that we will be using duvet covers to protect them for more long term use.Now for the positive: This blanket is so warm! Not too fluffy, which is what we wanted, but warm and cozy! I slept so well with it last night inside my new duvet, although I\'m annoyed that the blanket seems to already show lesser quality than expected, inside a duvet it should last MUCH longer than if we used and washed it regularly.Overall, not a horrible purchase.

That\'s why I went with the Lite version in the first place - why pay for a bunch of bells and whistles I\'m not going to use?As for the rest, though, I have no complaints. It was very simple and straightforward to set up and use. The stick is designed to plug into a spare HDMI port on the TV, but wouldn\'t fit due to a plug in the adjacent port. Fortunately they\'ve allowed for this eventuality by including a short HDMI extension lead, and that did the trick.After that, all I had to do was follow the on-screen instructions to link it to my wi-fi and then my streaming accounts. That was slightly time-consuming due to having to enter all the various passwords and authorization codes, but once it\'s done it\'s done and I can watch to my heart\'s content.The picture quality\'s fine and I\'ve had no problems.

My only minor quibble is that using the up/down/left/right buttons to search through menus can make my finger a bit sore (and yes, that wouldn\'t happen with Alexa, but then my throat might get sore!)Given its small size and cheapness this gadget punches way above its weight and I have no hesitation in recommending it.

INSERT INTO `amazon_sentiment` VALUES (0,'RTDVIT5SUMJP8','Europe','New Fire TV Lite is a fantastic budget streaming device! Upgrade!. I own the previous non-4k model, and this is a much better experience. First off, It\'s faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. The user interface is snappier and more responsive all around, unlike the older Fire Stick, which does occasionally lag. It\'s crisp and clear, and intuitive to operate - and set-up is a piece of cake.If you are wondering whether an elderly or technophobic person can handle the setup process, the answer is yes. The onscreen prompts guide you through everything, and should be easy for anyone to follow, even if don\'t consider yourself tech savvy. And in terms of the physical hardware, there are only like 2 steps: 1) Connect the Stick to a power source 2) Plug the Stick into any open HDMI port, which you\'ll find on the back or side of your TV.Also, If you\'re wondering if the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) suits you more. I would say it’s a question of personal preference. The Fire TV Stick Lite version does not support Dolby Atmos audio and the included Alexa Voice Remote Lite does not have power or volume buttons. Personally, the Lite version is fine for me as I have another remote which controls my TV’s volume and power button and I do not have a soundbar. However, I would recommend anyone with different devices connected to their TV such as soundbars to buy the Fire TV Stick (with TV controls) version as this would allow you to control everything all at once, however it is slightly higher in price compared to this one.Finally If you\'re wondering whether the Lite version is a gimmick or whether it\'s worth it, the answer is: it\'s worth it, because it\'s as if they ironed out all the little kinks and pain points to get the user to their chosen content as quickly as possible. All the little improvements in terms of the speed/function, and the upgraded Alexa remote with the new “guide” button which takes you straight to your videos makes the Lite version a pleasure to use.Amazon needs to keep up the good work. This Lite stick is a solid product and an excellent upgrade (for those on a budget) from the previous model. Hope this helps!','new tv lite fantast budget stream devic upgrad previou non4k model better experi faster previou stick menu lag thing smoother faster overal user interfac snappier respons unlik older stick doe occasion lag crisp clear intuit oper setup piec cakeif wonder elderli technophob person handl setup process answer ye onscreen prompt guid easi follow dont consid tech savvi term physic hardwar like 2 step 1 connect stick power sourc 2 plug stick open hdmi port youll tvalso your wonder tv stick tv control suit say question person prefer tv stick lite version doe support dolbi atmo audio includ alexa voic remot lite doe power volum button person lite version fine remot control tv volum power button soundbar recommend differ devic connect tv soundbar buy tv stick tv control version allow control slightli higher price compar onefin your wonder lite version gimmick worth answer worth iron littl kink pain point user chosen content quickli possibl littl improv term speedfunct upgrad alexa remot new guid button take straight video make lite version pleasur useamazon need good work lite stick solid product excel upgrad budget previou model hope help',0.039,0.789,0.172,0.9705,1,0,4),(1,'RW3QA8WMV68UM','Europe','Like any other Firestick, but with one irritating feature....so far. All functionality is quick and responsive as you would expect so can\'t be faulted in that respect.However, if, like me, you might side load some additional Apps onto your Firestick, which are not linked to your Amazon Account, you might see that the image / icon for the App does not appear in your Apps list and instead you get a \"greyed out\" box. The App will install and work fine once you open it, but the obvious visual for it is missing on your home screen and My Apps lists and if you have a few of them, you will have to guess which app you are opening. Example pictured.This Fire TV Lite OS is Version 7.2.2.3, presumably bang up to date, and this does not happen (in my experience) with previous OS on the 4k Stick for example which is version 6.2.7.3.I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and Factory resets but it is still the same.

We already have the more expensive fire stick in our main tv which we love.Our second tv doesnt support Brit Box so we decided on another fire stick but opted for this version as its quite a bit cheaper.The only difference is three buttons on the remote.

First off, the Navy and Gray colors aren\'tt as dark as the picture shows, no big deal to me as I wasn\'t concerned about the color as much as I was about it being washable and warm!We washed the Navy one first in a front loading washer - these are big comforters, not too puffy or thick but thick enough that it was a squeeze into the washer.

No stuffing had come out, but after one wash seams are already coming loose. We wash our blankets often, and the whole point of finding a washable comforter was so that we didn\'t need to buy duvet covers. However, after already washing both blankets, it\'s safe to say that we will be using duvet covers to protect them for more long term use.Now for the positive: This blanket is so warm! Not too fluffy, which is what we wanted, but warm and cozy! I slept so well with it last night inside my new duvet, although I\'m annoyed that the blanket seems to already show lesser quality than expected, inside a duvet it should last MUCH longer than if we used and washed it regularly.Overall, not a horrible purchase.

I haven\'t given any stars for Alexa integration, for the simple reason that I haven\'t used it. Can\'t be bothered with all this newfangled voice control stuff. That\'s why I went with the Lite version in the first place - why pay for a bunch of bells and whistles I\'m not going to use?As for the rest, though, I have no complaints. It was very simple and straightforward to set up and use. The stick is designed to plug into a spare HDMI port on the TV, but wouldn\'t fit due to a plug in the adjacent port. Fortunately they\'ve allowed for this eventuality by including a short HDMI extension lead, and that did the trick.After that, all I had to do was follow the on-screen instructions to link it to my wi-fi and then my streaming accounts. That was slightly time-consuming due to having to enter all the various passwords and authorization codes, but once it\'s done it\'s done and I can watch to my heart\'s content.The picture quality\'s fine and I\'ve had no problems. Watching Netflix and Amazon Prime shows via the Fire stick is an improvement from watching via Virgin, because there\'s no frame-rate incompatibility, so no motion judder.If a programme is left in pause for too long the screen will revert to a photo slideshow, but pressing the \"U-turn\" button will take you back to the Resume option.As for the remote, it\'s much smaller and lighter than those for my TV, Blu-ray, etc., but the controls are simple and intuitive. My only minor quibble is that using the up/down/left/right buttons to search through menus can make my finger a bit sore (and yes, that wouldn\'t happen with Alexa, but then my throat might get sore!)Given its small size and cheapness this gadget punches way above its weight and I have no hesitation in recommending it.

While this is predominantly advertising a comforter/blanket, it still uses the word \"set\" and features a fully made up bed.

Anyways.....aside from THAT huge disappointment.....I bought Cypress green and it is an army green which I like, but not as rich/bright as the product page photo. It is more muted/drab. The fabric is soft enough, the pillowcase is pretty thin, and the overall stitching on both the pillowcase and comforter looks like it won\'t last long before unraveling.

I loved the amount of positive reviews on this product which gave me confidence to purchase.  In particular, I was reading through them looking for how hot this comforter makes others feel as they sleep and found several mentions that people thought it was perfect.  Not too hot.  The comforter arrived almost a week earlier than estimated delivery, which was great!  I love the look of it and it has a really nice soft feel to it.  We went with the black in the oversized king size and it really looked nice on the bed (standard king), draping over the sides and end without touching the floor.  It quickly puffed up after unpacking and placing it on the bed (it comes vacuum sealed in a bag nice and small).Unfortunately for my wife and I, it just did not meet our expectations and was very hot to sleep under.  My wife, who is always cold, told me that she woke up sweating in the night and had moved it off of her.  I managed to sleep through the nights but woke up with the comforter pushed down below my knees.  The temps have been in the upper 60s in the house as fall is setting in, which typically would mean we both have the comforter on through the night. I will say it does have a decent weighted feeling to it as you are under it, and I’m sure some, if not a majority of others, will find this comforter perfect for their needs.  For us it was just too hot compared to our existing comforter.  For comparison/reference, this was meant to replace our current comforter which is one of the discontinued Sheex brand.For those curious about the customer service or reading other reviews about them, I contacted them about a return and even though it was a weekend I received a response back within a couple hours.  They’ve been simply amazing to deal with as a buyer, delivering much earlier than estimated, answering so promptly regarding a return, and refunding me in full while also providing an amazing solution to the issue of returning the product.  AMAZING customer service from this seller!
